Identify from any given data or document the ecological and social variables that correspond to each of the DPSIR categories, specifically in relation to resilience of agriculture in henan. Explain how categories relate between categories (e.g., how a Driver leads to a Pressure).
","Based on the provided documents, here is a comprehensive answer to the question:

**DPSIR Framework in Agricultural Resilience Context (Henan Province)**

1. **Driver:** 
   - Broad socio-economic or environmental forces: Climate variability, demographic trends, policy reforms.
   - Example from Document 3: ""In July 2021, Xun County suffered extremely heavy rainstorm and flood disaster while 94% of its population were affected.""

2. **Pressure:** 
   - Direct human-induced or natural stressors on agroecosystems: Land degradation, overuse of agrochemicals, irrigation intensity.
   - Example from Document 4: ""Regarding proximity to rivers, most villages are located at relatively longer distances, with some outliers raising the mean and showing a broader distribution of distances instead of clustering together.""

3. **State:** 
   - Current condition of the agroecosystem and socio-economic attributes: Soil fertility, water availability, biodiversity, farmer income, land tenure.
   - Example from Document 4: ""Quantitative analysis provides accurate numerical data for specific attributes of traditional villages...""

4. **Impact:** 
   - Consequences of changes in the state: Reduced crop yields, increased poverty, food insecurity, ecological degradation.
   - Example from Document 1: ""Non-grain conversions (NGC) of cultivated land pose a great threat to national food security...""

5. **Response:** 
   - Actions or interventions: Adaptive farming practices, subsidies, training programs, policy changes.
   - Example from Document 3: ""Research findings showed that resilient communities are those where village committees and residents can work cooperatively and coherently.""

**Relationship between Categories:**

- A Driver (e.g., climate variability) leads to a Pressure (e.g., land degradation).
- A Pressure (e.g., irrigation intensity) affects the State (e.g., water availability).
- Changes in the State (e.g., soil fertility) can lead to Impacts (e.g., reduced crop yields).
- The Response (e.g., adaptive farming practices) aims to mitigate the impacts of these changes.

**Ecological and Social Variables:**

- Ecological variables:
  - Soil fertility
  - Water availability
  - Biodiversity
  - Proximity to rivers
  - Elevation

- Social variables:
  - Farmer income
  - Land tenure
  - Perceived benefits (PB) of non-grain conversions
  - Perceived risks (PR) of non-grain conversions
  - Awareness and knowledge of potential disasters
  - Authority recognition
  - Individuals' cognition towards disaster
  - Economic development

Note that some variables may overlap between categories, but they are listed according to their primary association within each category.","[Document(metadata={'source_file': '0f8cb82f9dafc7adde60292578f0b27af4fd5acf25abde97d46e7c285f546a73.json'}, page_content='The influence of survival conditions on farmer willingness to participate in non-grain conversions of cultivated land based on the SOR model 1 College of Geography Science, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang, Henan, China, 2 Key Research Institute of the Yellow River Civilization and Sustainable Development, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China Citation: Fan H, Liu J, Shao X, Sun B, Yang Y, Shi C (2025) The influence of survival conditions on farmer willingness to participate in non-grain conversions of cultivated land based on the SOR model.

The editorial history of this article is available here: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0318441 Non-grain conversions (NGC) of cultivated land pose a great threat to national food secu- rity, and farmers are the direct actors in the NGC of cultivated land. Exploring the influence of farmer’ survival situation on their willingness to convert cultivated land to non-grain land can provide theoretical support for formulating control policies for NGC of cultivated land. Based on the data obtained from 650 questionnaires in Henan Province and using the SOR model as the theoretical basis, this study explored the impact mechanism of the sur- vival situations of two types of farmers, namely, those with agricultural livelihoods (AL) and those with nonagricultural livelinoods (NL), on their willingness to convert farmland into non-grain land through the use of structural equation models. The results are as follows. The perceived benefits (PB) of NGC can improve their willingness to convert farmland to non-grain land, while the perceived risks (PR) of NGC reduce their willingness to convert farmland to non-grain land. The influence of PB and PR on farmer willingness to engage in NGC of cultivated land in the near term is greater than that in the long term. The influ- ence mechanism of perceived income and perceived risk on the willingness of non-grain conversions of cultivated land varies with the livelihood types of the farmers. The influ- ences of internal family situation (IS) and external family situations (ES) on the willingness to engage in NGC of cultivated land differ according to the types of farmer livelihood. There are differences in the influence mechanism of survival situations on different types of farmers’ willingness to non-grain conversion of cultivated land. Copyright: © 2025 Fan et al.

Food forms the foundation of national prosperity and is one of the key resources for the continuation of civilization. Food security is “the greatest concern of a nation” [1]. Govern- ments around the world have implemented food security as an important strategy. In recent years, China’s urbanization and industrialization have developed rapidly, and remarkable achievements have been made in economic construction. However, these achievements have Data availability statement: All the data related to this study have been included in the paper and its Supporting Information files. Funding: The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71904150, 41771438) and General Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Research in Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province (Grant number 2024-ZZJH-039). also brought great challenges to cultivated land protection and food security. The continuous spread of cities has threatened regional food security [2]. The rapid decrease in the scale of cultivated land in China has increased the risks to resources and food security [3]. From a strategic perspective, the Chinese government has the responsibility to ensure the country’s food security and to make food production self-sufficient [4]. The Chinese government has always attached great importance to food security. The Central Rural Work Conference held at the end of 2022 and the No. 1 Central Document of 2023 contain important instructions on food security and cultivated land protection. Currently, food security is facing many chal- lenges, especially the NGC of cultivated land. Research shows that the NGC rate of cultivated land in China is approximately 27%, among which the proportion of NGC of cultivated land in Southwest China is as high as 46% [5].'), Document(metadata={'source_file': 's41598-023-35486-w.json'}, page_content=""Meanwhile, some spatial results on TVs and RTCVs have been obtained**”’. However, most studies are imited to the spatial distribution of TVs or RTCVs themselves*”*!, studies on the correlation between the spatial distribution of ancient villages and tourism development elements*, and studies on rural tourism in typical TVs**-**. In addition, there are some similarities in the spatial distribution between historical villages and overty-stricken villages*®. Thus, research on the spatial structure and coupling of TV and RTCV can provide a clearer understanding of the economic situation in different rural areas, and a more precise rural development strategy will be implemented. The symbiotic spatial structure of the two can be applied to other developing countries and regions to provide an effective reference value for the sustainable development of rural tourism. The research area of this paper is Henan Province, which is the largest agricultural province and one of the rovinces with a large population in China’’. In terms of population size, geographical area and economic out- ut, it is comparable to medium-sized countries on the European continent, such as Sweden**”. In addition, Henan has complex and diverse topography and is rich in tourist resources and cultural diversity, with a similar spatial distribution of traditional villages and rural tourism destinations*”“'. This paper aims, first, to study the spatial distribution modes of TVs and RTCVs and to explore the relationships between the spatial distribution characteristics of villages and the multidimensional impact factors at the provincial level. Furthermore, their ernel density coupling relationship at the township level was revealed using spatial correlation. Finally, accord- ing to the analysis results, the spatial structure of rural tourism characteristic villages and traditional villages are discussed based on the theory of regional symbiosis. The research results can provide a reference for the sustainable development of traditional villages and rural tourism. Study area. Henan Province was named Yuzhou in ancient times and is known as ‘the hinterland of ancient China and the thoroughfare of ten provinces. It is one of the important cradles of the Chinese nation and an important comprehensive transportation hub and information flow logistics center in China. Henan Province is bounded between 31° 23’ N-36° 22’ N and 110° 21' E-116° 39’ E with a total area of 167,000 km? and is in the transition area of the second and third steps in central China (Fig. 1). It is surrounded by mountains on three sides with high terrain in the west and low terrain in the east. The northern border is the Taihang Mountain region, the western border is the Funiu Mountains region, and the southern border is the Ta-pieh Mountains. The farming culture and geographical characteristics have created a fully preserved ancient village culture and rural tourism resources. The Henan Provincial government announced 6 batches of 1019 provincial-level TVs and 4 batches of 471 provincial-level RTCVs by 2022. Data sources. To study the spatial correlation between the distribution of TVs and RTCVs in Henan Province, this paper took 1019 TVs (see Supplementary Table $1 online) and 471 RTCVs (see Supplementary Table S2 online) as the objects identified by the Henan People’s Government. They were abstracted as points by calibrating longitude and latitude via the Baidu API. QGIS 3.30, GeoDa 1.20, and other analytical tools were used to analyze the role of environmental factors and social factors. Relevant data sources include (1) the topo- graphic information of Henan Province DEM raster data with a resolution of 30 m and river data derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/); (2) the administrative region (points) data were derived from the National Basic Geographic Information Center (http://www.ngcc.cn/); (3) the list of A-level scenic spots (see Supplementary Table $3 online) came from the Henan General Office of Culture and Tourism; and (4) data on population, per capita disposable income of all residents, road mileage and others were obtained from the national economic and social development statistical bulletin of relevant cities and prefectures in Henan Province in 2021 (the data, such as Henan Province 30 m DEM raster data, river system data, administrative region (points) data, population, per capita GDP data of county or city and road mileage. see Supplementary Data Collection D1 online).""), Document(metadata={'source_file': 's41598-024-70719-6.json'}, page_content=""In this study, we consider rural community resilience as a capacity which not only recognizes and anticipates the scope of damages, but also integrates multiple actors (public, private, nonprofit organizations) and coordi- nates their actions when facing natural disasters and other shocks. What’s more, besides those external support from the public organizations and governments, a key hypothesis underpinning the research of the paper is that local stakeholders’ cognition and their actions before, during and after disasters play an essential role in build- ing community resilience. In this sense, the paper aims to examine rural community resilience to disaster from the perspective of individuals’ cognition to disaster and their follow-up actions. The study area of this paper is Xun County which is located in Central China’s Henan Province. In July 2021, Xun County suffered extremely heavy rainstorm and flood disaster while 94% of its population were affected. This flood was unusual and can be used as a suitable research case to examine rural communities’ disaster response, post-disaster recovery as well as local residents’ cognition to disaster. The structure of the paper is as follows. After the introduction, the paper reviews related literatures and creates a theoretical framework by integrating people’s cognition, follow-up action and community resilience. The third section illustrates the study area, research methodology and data source. The fourth section displays and analyzes the research results. In the end, the paper closes by discussing research findings and conclusions. To date, scholars have used various methods to measure community resilience given the fact that there are no universally accepted measurement tools. Data limitation and diverging indicators of resilience are also challeng- ing the measurement of community resilience. Kapucu et al.?* conducted mail and online survey of emergency management professionals in eight Central Florida counties of the US to investigate the characteristics of disaster management in rural communities and ways to strengthen emergency management systems to develop and improve community disaster resilience. Boon’ carried out individual and group interviews of four disaster- impacted rural communities in Australia and examined significant generic factors to community resilience based on people’s views and attitudes. Hong et al.” used people’s mobility data (800,000 mobile devices) before, during and after the hurricane Harvey in the US in 2017 and measured inequality of community resilience which was considered as a function of the magnitude of impact and time to recovery. Suet al.*° depicted the evolution of rural community resilience in China’s Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and found changing stages of resilience given to the differences of governmental interventions and community self-organiza- tion abilities. What's more, there are also studies focusing on local stakeholders’ perceived community resilience which is measured by assessing individual’s perceptions of their community’s reactions to natural disasters””*!-**. Given the above descriptions about community resilience, we believe that it is the local villagers’ views, aware- ness and attitudes as well as their behaviors that form and support community disaster resilience. As Imperiale and Vanclay**° indicated, community resilience has both cognitive and interactional dimensions. Resilient communities are normally considered to be the places where residents tend to have better cognition and aware- ness of local vulnerabilities and stronger intention and bottom-up initiatives to change the situation'’. This is manifested by their decision making and actions when dealing with challenges and shocks. And this further explains why some rural communities are more resilient than others when disasters occur. Generally, individuals’ cognition towards disaster consists of four dimensions. The first dimension is their awareness and knowledge of potential disasters to local communities. This tightly relates to disaster preven- tion, preparedness and mitigation programs before disaster occurs. Sim et al.*° highlighted that comparing with material aid, the awareness of disaster prevention and public participation are the key variables which are significantly and positively correlated with community disaster resilience. The second cognition dimension is individual’s authority recognition under which the local villagers will follow orders and arrangements issued by the community committee during the disaster resistance and recovery periods. This helps to guarantee the unity of local residents’ action to mitigate disaster instead of staying in chaos. The importance and effective- ness of authority recognition were proved in Yang et al’s** study of measuring community disaster resilience in China’s Loess Plateau. Research findings showed that resilient communities are those where village committees and residents can work cooperatively and coherently. The third dimension of cognition is individuals’ aware- ness of self-participation and active involvement in resisting and mitigating disasters. This tightly connects to individuals’ sense of place and their local identity which are considered as the fourth dimension of cognition.""), Document(metadata={'source_file': 's41598-025-87145-x.json'}, page_content='Quantitative analysis provides accurate numerical data for specific attributes of traditional villages, and we visualize these values in a three-dimensional coordinate system (Fig. 5). To analyze the trend of each quantitative indicator of traditional villages in both the east-west and north-south directions, it is useful to map the data scatter to the elevation, represented by the two coordinate axes of the bottom surface (longitude in the northwest- southeast direction and latitude in the northeast-southwest direction) along with the vertical axis. Subsequently, using the fitted surface resulting from this mapping process enables a more in-depth analysis of the overall trend exhibited by a specific indicator. The traditional villages in Henan Province exhibit a varied elevation profile, with a relatively high mean elevation and noticeable variability (Table 3). Although most villages are situated at lower elevations, a few outliers in locations such as the Taihang Mountains, Wangwu Mountains, and Funiu Mountains significantly raise the mean elevation (Fig. 5). Regarding proximity to rivers, most villages are located at relatively longer distances, with some outliers raising the mean and showing a broader distribution of distances instead of clustering together (Table 3). Additionally, most traditional villages are not situated in areas with dense river networks, a trend that is especially pronounced in the western part of Anyang City in northern Henan (Fig. 5). The trends in the Shape Index and Fractal Dimension show relatively high consistency, generally decreasing from northeast to southwest (Fig. 5). The positive skewness and higher kurtosis in the Shape Index indicate the presence of various irregular shapes, whereas the relatively consistent and lower values in the Fractal Dimension suggest less variability in geometric complexity. Furthermore, approximately 19.5% of the areas exhibit Shape Index values greater than 4, with nearly half concentrated in Xinyang City, indicating that the terrain in southern Henan has a more pronounced impact on the spatial patterns of traditional villages. The three indicators of the road network display similar patterns (Fig. 5), with Farness decreases from north to south, connection decreases from northeast to southwest, and Betweenness decreases from northwest to southeast. The standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of connection are low, indicating that most villages form well-connected clusters. In contrast, the skewness and kurtosis of Farness and between are high, with a few villages occupying significant positions as transportation hubs or interaction centers. These findings collectively provide a detailed description of the dynamic transportation network. The average Mixing Degree is 41.7%, falling below the 50% benchmark (Table 3). Only 14.6% of the villages have a Mixing Degree surpassing 70%, underscoring the pressure to intensify the protection of the original architectural forms This degree across the province decreases significantly from southeast to northwest, closely mirroring the spatial distribution of economic development (Fig. 5), reflecting the influence of farmers’ “traditional thinking” on the construction of new houses (modern style) and the protection of traditional village buildings. When comparing the consistency area, direction, and distance for architectural patterns, the area consistency is better, followed by angle and distance consistency (Table 3). Spatially, area consistency is lower in the center and higher around, whereas the angle and distance consistency are the opposite, being higher in the center and lower around (Fig. 5). According to the actual form, the central region of Henan exhibits relatively flat terrain, with larger and denser rural settlements, resulting in a pattern of ""small individual, large overall, and irregular arrangement"". Conversely, in the northern, western, and southern regions of Henan, characterized by rugged terrain, smaller village sizes, and lower population density, a pattern of ""large individual, small overall, and regular arrangement"" appears to form. The cross-scale study of macro, meso, and micro levels provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of traditional villages. From a macro perspective, village development is shaped by topography and river distances, which provide natural defense but limit expansion. At the meso level, the intricate traffic network reflects spatial hierarchies and diverse connections that influence village-wide movement. At the micro level, architectural preservation becomes crucial due to the influence of economic development and traditional mindsets. The cross-analysis process intricately weaves together geographical, cultural, and economic dimensions, offering a comprehensive depiction of the subtle forces at play in the evolution of traditional villages and providing a coherent narrative of the village\'s development.')]",0.6628804314759471,0.5281977431991576,1.0,0.8125,0.7,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.31645764791910347,0.37308103112781943,"[0.3668127004601268, 0.38036995256637884, 0.3961182100068982, 0.349023261477874]","{'scores': [1.0, 1.0], 'mean': 1.0, 'std': 0.0, 'min': 1.0, 'max': 1.0}","{'scores': [0.0, 0.0], 'mean': 0.0, 'std': 0.0, 'min': 0.0, 'max': 0.0}"
