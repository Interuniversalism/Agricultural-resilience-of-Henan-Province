PLoS ONE 16(9): e0256439.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0256439 The thermal environment of village public space affects the comfort of people ’ s outdoor activities, and then affects the willingness of residents to outdoor activities, which has an important impact on the villagers’ quality of life. Previously published studies of thermal com- fort mostly focused on the evaluation of thermal comfort index, few studies on the applica- tion of thermal comfort planning. The study was carried out in Maling Village, Changdai Town, Mengjin County, Luoyang City, Henan Province, China. Square, street, green space were chosen as three typical public spaces where thermal comfort indexes were measured by questionnaire survey and field measurement during summer. Subsequently, the village’s microclimate environment was simulated with ArcGIS 10.6 and ENVI-met. The results indi- cate that during the summer, the influences of temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity on the subjective comfort conditions of the outdoor environment gradually decreased. The spatial form of village has an important influence on thermal comfort. Finally, based on the results, this study put forward the thermal comfort process and plan- ning scheme of the village outdoor space.

Approximately half the world’s population lives in rural areas [1], the outdoor spaces of which have great functional importance in the residents’ lives. Rapid urbanisation has disturbed the rural outdoor environment [2]. In the past, rural planning has primarily considered spatial lay- out, culture, ecology, and other village functions [3, 4]. As such, the relationship between a vil- lage’s spatial form and microclimate has most neglected. The state of thermal comfort in the village outdoor space is bad, which has lowered villagers’ willingness of outdoor activities [5– 7]. Thermal comfort, as the most direct reflection of the human body to environment, has quickly become a hot spot in the study of microclimate outdoor [8]. Studies of thermal comfort conditions can be traced back to the 1930s [9]. Currently, thermal comfort is defined as the ‘condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and can be assessed by subjective evaluation’ [10]. There are three aspects of factors that affect outdoor thermal comfort: the physical, personal, and social. Physical factors include air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed [11]. Personal and social factors include a resident’s gender, age, metabolism, residence time, emotional status, cultural background, environmental attitude and cloth conditions [12–14]. 21], including outdoor air temperature, relative humidity, black ball temperature and wind speed and other environmental parameters, as well as the subjective questionnaire survey in the study area [22, 23]. The purpose of field measurements was to determine the thermal con- ditions that are comfortable or acceptable for local residents, understand the residents’ percep- tions of thermal comfort [24, 25]. The case studies focus on the livability evaluation of outdoor thermal environment, and the influence of urban form, ventilation and heat island to outdoor thermal comfort [26, 27]. Recently, with the development of science and technology, numeri- cal simulation has become an important means of outdoor thermal environment analysis, and the ENVI-met software has been one of the most widely used platforms [28–30]. ENVI-met is suitable for small- and medium-scale microclimate simulations; it has been used in relevant case studies of hot-summer-cold-winter regions [31], hot-summer-warm-winter regions [29, 30], temperate regions [32, 33], cold regions [34], hot and arid regions [35, 36], and tropical regions [37, 38]. Furthermore, it has been applied to many different outdoor microclimate spaces, such as streets [39], campus areas [40], parks [41], residential communities [42] and green-roofs [43].",
    "The most common thermal-comfort evaluation indexes are the standard effective tempera- ture (SET), predicted mean vote (PMV), PET (physiological equivalent temperature), universal thermal climate index (UTCI), mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and discomfort index (DI) [44, 45]. The PMV is determined by the stable indoor environment [46], and a seven-point scale is often used to predict the average thermal response of many people in indoor thermal-comfort evaluations [47]. The UTCI is an easy-to-deter- mine body heat index, which can be applied to different seasons, climates, and dimensions [48, 49]. Furthermore, the WBGT, SET, Tmrt, and DI have been widely used to assess the outdoor thermal comfort characteristics of different climate zones [50–52]. The PET, which is more sensitive than UTCI to changes in human thermal response, is a widely studied parameter in thermal-comfort research on weather forecasting, urban planning and design [53–55], and the outdoor evaluation of complex environments in different climate zones [56, 57]. At present, outdoor thermal comfort research is mostly concentrated in urban public space. A large number of scholars have carried out specific research on different public spaces such as squares [58–60], parks [41, 50, 61] and streets [62–64]. The effects of solar radiation, ventila- tion and human activities on temperature in different public spaces are the main research directions [65–67]. Other scholars studied microclimate based on urban local climate zone [68–74]. Nevertheless, the research of village thermal environment is based on architecture and climatology, and its influence on village thermal environment is mainly analyzed from the perspective of village architectural form [75–78]. A large number of scholars analyze the rela- tionship between buildings and rural climate adaptability from the aspects of building layout [79, 80], form [81], and materials [82]. In general, the research on village thermal comfort mainly focuses on micro-climate environment [83], thermal comfort [84], climate adaptability characteristics [85], energy consumption [86], and the influence of architectural form on ther- mal comfort [78], etc. In summary, the research methods and theoretical system of public thermal comfort has been relatively mature. However, the research on thermal comfort of rural public space is still not in-depth, especially the planning research on thermal environment. In this study, the Arc- GIS 10.6 platform, ENVI-met 4.4.5 software, and PET index were used to evaluate the thermal comfort characteristics of outdoor public spaces (i.e., streets, squares, and green space) in Mal- ing Village, Henan, China. Subsequently, the thermal comfort simulation was carried out, and a specific village thermal-comfort planning scheme and process are proposed. The field studies were conducted in Maling village, Changdai Town, Mengjin County, Luo- yang City, Henan Province, China (Fig 1A). The public open space of the village was taken as the study area. This study was supported by the local government and the masses. The ques- tionnaire survey and field measurement did not involve endangered or protected species. For a detailed explanation, please see the S1 File. The study area is in a typical hilly village in the west of Changdai Town, Mengjin County, Luo- yang City, Henan Province, China (Fig 1A). It belongs to the warm-temperate (Dwa) [87] cli- mate zone, which is hot and rainy during the summer and cold and dry during the winter. The meteorological statistics from 2010 to 2019 in Fig 1B presents the meteorological data from the China Meteorological Information Centre [88]. The land use data of Maling Village originated from China’s third land survey, which was conducted in 2018 (Fig 1C). Maling Village has a total area of 51 ha and a population of 1419. Agriculture is a crucial sector of Maling Village. Furthermore, the village has well-equipped public service facilities, and residents can perform a variety of outdoor activities in street spaces, squares and many other green spaces. The average building height is relatively low (one to three storeys high). Three typical public spaces (squares, streets, and green space) in Maling Village were chosen as study areas. A total of 15 measurement points were selected. Seven measurement points were on roads (the measurement points were located on the central axes of roads with buildings on both sides), including four east–west streets and three north–south streets. In addition, four measurement points were in the squares and green spaces of the village, respectively. The spe- cific positions of the measurement points are shown in Fig 2. Moreover, Fig 3 lists the current spatial measurement points.",
    "The first step is the assessment of thermal sensation and thermal comfort and the explora- tion the effect of temporal distribution regularities and microclimate parameters on residents’ outdoor activities. The second step is the measurement of microclimate in the selected public space. The third step is the evaluation of outdoor thermal comfort based on PET index. The fourth step is the establishment of the relationship between PET and thermal 2.4.1. Evaluation of overall thermal sensation and thermal comfort characteristics. The study was performed during the summer (from June 12th to 17th, 2020), which are all sunny days, the village’s roads, squares, and green spaces were visited, and residents doing Fig 1. (a) Geographic location of the study area. (b) Monthly mean/maximal/minimal air temperature and mean relative humidity in Mengjin County from 2010 to 2019. (c) Land use map. (The satellite images in Fig 1 (a) with permission from Beijing Qianfan Shijing Co., Ltd, original copyright [2020] [96]). outdoor activities were randomly selected for the survey. 450 local villagers (with ages ranging from 18 to 70; with a 1:1 ratio of men to women) were invited to participate in the survey (Before the interviewees answered the questionnaire, they were asked to sit quietly for 20 min in a shaded area within a 1 min walk from the test site; the purpose of this was to achieve a uni- form metabolic rate). Finally, 412 valid questionnaires were obtained. All data were collected through a questionnaire (S1 File), and the subjective data are provided in S2 File. The questionnaire consist of two parts: basic information about the interviewees and ther- mal-sensation votes (TSV). Basic information contains gender, age, weight, clothing, types of outdoor activities, and the time they spent outdoors. The TSV contains thermal-sensation and thermal-comfort. Thermal-sensation is presented with the ASHRAE-13 seven-point scale [89], thermal-comfort is presented with five-point scale [61] (Figs 5 and 6). In the questionnaire, the public space were classified into eight categories: 2.4.2 Microclimate measurement. The questionnaire study and field measurements were conducted simultaneously; The study was performed during the summer (from June 12th to 17th, 2020); the period covered weekends and working days; data from days with rainly weather condition were excluded. Measurements were made every two hours from 6:00 until 20:00. The measurement time at each sampling point was 5 min. The selected microclimate indicators, such as the thermal environment parameters of dif- ferent squares, the varying orientations of streets, and the locations of green spaces, were mea- sured during the selected time period. Based on the measurement and analysis results of three different measurement points at a height of 1.5 m, the data/information of black globe temper- ature, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed at each measurement point were 2.4.3 Thermal comfort indices. The PET index was chosen based on the subjective data and field measurements to evaluate the outdoor thermal comfort characteristics of the village. The index comprehensively analyses the effects of all physiologically related weather indexes (the air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and mean radiation temperature) and per- sonal parameters (the metabolic rate and clothing insulation level). The corresponding thermal sensation and thermal stress (physiological stress) are shown in Table 2 [90]. The RayMan software was applied to calculate the PET [91]. It was assumed that the ther- mal resistance of clothing (0.9 clo) and active metabolic rate (80 W) remain constant during the calculation, and the physical parameters of the thermal environment were the input parameters (which included the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean radiation tem- perature (Tmrt)). For outdoor measurements, the mean radiant temperature can be obtained by approxima- tion from the black globe temperature, air temperature, and wind speed [92]: where Tmrt is the mean radiant temperature; Tg is the black globe temperature (˚C); Ta is the air temperature (˚C); Va is the wind speed (m/s); D is the globe diameter (0.05 m in this study), and Ɛ is the emissivity (0.95 for a black globe). 2.4.4 Correlation between PET and MTSV. The relationship between the PET and mean TSV of the village’s thermal environment during the summer was studied, and the village’s neutral temperature range during the summer was determined. 2.4.5 Numerical simulation and thermal-comfort plan for the village. Based on field measurement, the ENVI-met model and measurement results were used to simulate the village’s microclimate. the ArcGIS 10.6 platform was applied for the analysis, and a thermal-comfort plan that is specific to the village was established. The model area of Maling Village is approxi- mately 30 hm2. The sunny June 14th, 2020 was chosen for the simulation. The simulation took 24 h (from 06: 00 (GMT + 8), and the simulation intervals were 60 min. Based on the field inves- tigation results, 91 satellite images, and ArcGIS 10.6, the study area was transformed into a base map with BMP format, which can be recognised by ENVI-Met 4.4.5. The map was imported into the sub-module ‘SPACE’ to establish the model. The maximal building height was set to 17.5 m, and the grid dimensions were defined at 100 × 60 × 30 cells. According to the dimen- sions and building height of the study area, the grid resolution was set to dx = dy = dz = 2 m, with four nested grids in the peripheral area. The initial microclimate data were the weather data of the macro climate environment on June 14th, 2020. The dominant wind direction was 170˚; the model roughness length was 0.1, and the underlying surfaces of the model area were an asphalt road and a grey concrete road. The early simulation was based on the actual condi- tions of the measurement sites, and the later simulation was based on the village’s thermal-com- fort plan. In addition, the pre-set scheme was used to simulate the microclimate, and the PET indexes were chosen to comprehensively evaluate the village’s thermal environment.",
    "3.1.1. Temporal distribution of outdoor activities and preferences regarding thermal environment parameters. On working days during the summer, villagers prefer to perform outdoor activities in the morning and evening (mainly between 6:00 and 8:00 and after 16:00) because solar radiation is weaker during those times. The most active time period on weekends is between 18:00 and 20:00 (Table 3) because young people have more time for outdoor activi- ties during evening hours. Therefore, the period during which residents go to public spaces and perform outdoor activities is advanced. According to the villagers’ preferences regarding the thermal environment parameters, the four microclimate parameters’ degrees of influence in relation to thermal comfort are as follows: air temperature > solar radiation > wind speed > and relative humidity (Fig 7). 49% of the interviewees stated that temperature had the greatest impact on the their outdoor activities in summer; 24% of the respondents believed that long-term exposure to the summer sun will cause discomfort. In addition, a few of the respondents reported that the summer wind cools the public spaces, improving thermal comfort characteristics. The majority of respondents reported that they do not think relative humidity significantly affects the thermal comfort level. 3.1.2. Characteristics of thermal comfort and thermal sensation. (1) Evaluation results of overall thermal comfort. The summer survey results are shown in Fig 8. 67% of the respon- dents stated that the area shaded by trees has the highest comfort level, followed by the green spaces of parks (51%); 49% of the respondents stated that the thermal environment of unshaded lawns is ‘neutral’. In addition, 13% of the respondents stated that the road environ- ment is the lowest in terms of comfort. The village’s public spaces in the order of high-to-low thermal-comfort are as follows: green spaces in parks > areas with shading from buildings > artificial structures > unsheltered squares > roads. (A: space with fitness facilities; B: unsheltered square; C: shading from trees; D: unshaded lawns; E: green spaces in parks; F: pavilions; G: areas with shading from buildings; H: roads). (2) Overall evaluation results of TSV. The TSV distribution is shown in Fig 9; the values are mainly distributed in the moderate and over-hot ranges (TSV � 0). According to the results, during the test period, the outdoor thermal environment of Maling Village is hot during the summer. The proportion of respondents who felt ‘TSV = 0’ was the highest; thus, most villag- ers have adapted well to the thermal environment. Most people reported feeling ‘hot’ and ‘very hot’ on the road and ‘hot’ in the unsheltered square. In addition, the respondents reported dif- ferent thermal sensations for different types of spaces. This indicates that there are significant differences between different types of spaces in terms of in simultaneous thermal sensations. (A: space with fitness facilities; B: unsheltered square; C: shading from trees; D: unshaded lawns; E: green spaces in parks; F: pavilions; G: areas with shading from buildings; H: roads). (3) Mean TSV and PET. The weighted mean values of the PET and TSV were calculated and fitted with a linear model. As shown in Fig 10, the overall scatter distribution is close to the fitting curve R2 = 0.8105. For a MTSV of 0–0.5, the neutral temperature of the human body corresponding to the PET is 23.77–27.23˚C; the range of the neutral-temperature PET includes ‘no heat stress’ and ‘slight heat stress’. The results reveal a strong correlation between the PET and MTSV, and the degree of fit is good. lies in a sunken square. The east side, which is near the road, is greatly affected by the natu- ral wind direction; by contrast, the wind speed of Point 14 is the lowest because the wind is largely blocked by the building. approximately 14:00 (38.7˚C); during this time, the air temperature at Point 15 was the low- est (34.9˚C; the difference between the maximum and minimum was 3.8˚C). This was due to the building on the east side of Point 15 being higher than that on the west side and pro- viding shading. According to the analysis results of the mean temperature at each measure- ment point on the East–West street, the mean air temperature at Point 12 is 32.6˚C, which is lower than the temperatures at Points 5, 8, and 11. This difference in temperature is mainly due to the shading from the tall trees lining both sides of the road at Point 12; in contrast, Points 5, 8, and 11 have fewer trees in their vicinity.",
    "40˚C). This is mainly due to the fact that the plants at Point 13 are wild and of the low ground- cover type; the area is primarily covered by unsheltered grassland without planted trees. 3.2.2 Comparison of thermal environments. The mean values of three different space climate impact parameters were studied to compare the corresponding thermal environments; Table 4 presents the results. block the sunlight and reduce the mean black globe temperature. Consequently, the mean black globe temperature of the village’s green space is much lower than that of the road. 3.2.3 Simulation of factors that affect thermal comfort. The dominant wind direction of the village was south–east on June 14th, 2020. The wind speed distribution within the study area is shown in Fig 17A; the wind speed was generally 0.00–2.45 m/s. For some open public spaces in the middle of the study area, the wind speed reached 0.54–1.36 m/s. Due to canyon effect, the highest wind speed reach between 1.36 and 2.45 m/s at the east side of the village, where buildings are tall. Moreover, the wind speeds at the south and north of the village are greater (1.36–1.63 m/s); this is primarily because the areas are not blocked by buildings. The terrain on the south side is high; the site is spacious; and the overall space is well ventilated. In addition, the solar radiation intensity around the village buildings remains in a comfortable range (indicated by the blue colour). However, owing to the village’s low buildings and the rel- atively sparse plants, the solar radiation intensities of the village road and square are high at 14:00. The simulation map of the air temperature and relative humidity in the village is shown in Fig 17C and 17D. The temperature of the study area increases gradually from 30.2 to 38.2˚C (from dark blue to red). Owing to the tall buildings in the east of the village and the relatively open layout, the temperature is the lowest in this area. This value is followed by that of the green area in the middle of the village (green and light-yellow zones in the map). This area includes a lot of green space, which has an evident cooling effect at 14:00. In addition, the tem- perature values of the north and west sides of the village are the highest, whereas the tempera- ture values in the east and south of the denser areas are lower. Therefore, shading provided by buildings and trees can reduce the ambient temperature. The overall humidity of the village was found to range from 35.52% to 80.32%. According to the current conditions, the east side of the village has much open space, rich vegetation, and high air mobility, all of which lead to a high relative humidity. In contrast, due to the high building density on the streets of Market Road, the hard pavement of the public space, and poor vegetation, the relative humidity is the lowest. 3.2.4 Thermal-comfort plan for the village. From the site measurements, microclimate simulations, and current land use map of the village (Fig 1C), it can be concluded that the fac- tors affecting thermal comfort are the geographical location, nature of the underlying surface, plant configuration, types of outdoor activities, and building layout, among others. The aim of a thermal-comfort plan is to mitigate the deficiencies of public spaces. The thermal comfort level and planning approaches for the outdoor space of the village are listed in Table 5. Based on the previously presented analysis, the thermal-comfort plan was classified into four parts: building layout optimisation, square layout optimisation, road layout optimisation, and green space layout optimisation. The sunshade mode of the public space in the village combines shading from buildings and plants. In addition, the plan includes three new squares (S5, S6, and S7) and two new green spaces (G5 and G6), and the layout of the local roads is improved. The present thermal-comfort map and proposed design plan are shown in Fig 18A and 18B. The details are as follows: different requirements for thermal comfort during the winter and summer should be con- sidered. The proposed plan includes deciduous plants, evergreen plants, and local trees with high branching points. For example, deciduous trees with broad canopies can be planted around the garden road in the green space, and trees, shrubs, and grass land Fig 18. (a) Current map of the village’s public spaces. (b) Thermal-comfort plan of the village’s public spaces. (The satellite images in Fig 18(a) and 18(b) with permission from Beijing Qianfan Shijing Co., Ltd, original copyright [2020] [96]).",
    "with a lower temperature between Points 6 and 11; by contrast, the simulation results (Fig 17C) shows an area with a higher temperature between Points 6 and 11. Thus, the software provides more comprehensive results. Moreover, the building height has an evident influ- ence on the wind speed, temperature, solar radiation, and humidity in the village. Never- theless, the building height must meet the thermal comfort and overall stylistic and cultural requirements of the village. The shortcomings of the spatial analysis method can be overcome by performing additional ENVI-met simulations. The data from the subjective questionnaire survey and agree well with the objective analy- sis and reveal some evident problems. For example, the roads and squares have poor ther- mal comfort conditions, which cause a ‘hot’ sensation during the summer. Therefore, in the future, more attention should be paid to the thermal comfort conditions of the streets and squares in Maling Village. During the summer, the villagers perform outdoor activi- ties more frequently in cooler areas. A comfortable temperature, humidity, and wind envi- ronment can effectively reduce the heat and prolong the residents’ outdoor activities. The layout should consider the shapes of the open spaces, plant configurations, nature of the underlying surface, and building heights and layouts as well as other factors. First of all. I would like to thank the support of the project funding.
