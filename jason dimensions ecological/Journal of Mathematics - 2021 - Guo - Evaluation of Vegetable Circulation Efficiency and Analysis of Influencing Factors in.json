In order to explore the deep-seated reasons aﬀecting the development of vegetable circulation in Henan Province, combined with the panel data of Henan Province from 2014 to 2019, this paper ﬁrst makes a static analysis on the vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province by using DEA method. Second, the Malmquist method is used to establish the total factor productivity evaluation model of vegetable circulation in Henan Province, and the dynamic analysis is carried out. -e analysis results show that the main problem in the development of vegetable circulation in Henan Province is the low level of management and technology.-en, GM(1, N) model is established to further analyze the speciﬁc factors aﬀecting the vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province. Finally, some reasonable suggestions are put forward for the development of vegetable circulation in Henan Province. Vegetable circulation plays a very important role in commodity circulation, which is not only related to the vital interests of farmers but also related to the devel- opment of China’s agricultural economy. Vegetable circulation is the link between production and sales, also an important guarantee to realize the value of vegetables and increase farmers’ income. In economics, eﬃciency usually refers to the ratio of output to input in economic activities. Vegetable circulation eﬃciency refers to the ratio of output to input in the process of vegetable cir- culation, which reﬂects the eﬀectiveness of resource al- location. In recent years, the scale of vegetable production in Henan Province has expanded year by year. In order to ensure the increase of farmers’ production and income, it is urgent to improve the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation and promote the high-quality de- velopment of vegetable circulation. -erefore, the re- search on vegetable circulation eﬃciency has important practical signiﬁcance. -e research of vegetable circulation eﬃciency not only enriches the theoretical system of vegetable circulation re- search and expands the space and vision of vegetable cir- culation research but also reduces the cost and loss of vegetable circulation, which is conducive to improving the income level of farmers. Scholars have studied the current situation and problems of vegetable circulation from dif- ferent perspectives. Zhang [1] believes that the main problems existing in the circulation of vegetable market in China are the lag of infrastructure construction of vegetable market, the imperfection of vegetable market system and market mechanism, and the low degree of organization of vegetable circulation subject. Yuan and Xin [2] believe that government departments should formulate relevant ﬂexible policies, stabilize vegetable production and sales prices, monitor the demand change information of residents in real time, and guide farmers to plant diﬀerently. Wang and Chen [3] believe that the main problems in China’s vegetable circulation are low degree of organization, many circulation links, and low degree of standardization. Wu and Mu [4] used the spatial dynamic panel model to analyze the spatial- temporal correlation and inﬂuencing factors of regional circulation of vegetables. Kuang et al. [5] believe that cul- tivating and strengthening the main body of production and dredging the links of productionand marketing are powerful means to promote the quality and eﬃciency of vegetable industry. Shang and Huang [6] found that the traditional vegetable circulation mode occupies the main position, and the wholesale market occupies the core position in the vegetable circulation. Shen et al. [7] proposed strengthening the release of information early warning, guiding farmers to grow rationally, innovating and improving the circulation mode, and promoting the docking of vegetable production and marketing. Shen and Mu [8] found that Beijing vege- table market operation has obvious seasonality. On the analysis and evaluation of vegetable circulation eﬃciency, scholars have studied it from various angles and achieved fruitful results. Zhou and Lu [9] analyzed the ef- ﬁciency of diﬀerent circulation channels of fresh vegetables in Nanjing. Su [10] thought that the circulation eﬃciency of agricultural products mainly depends on the wholesale link and proposed that the construction of agricultural products wholesale market should be strengthened. He and Wu [11] proposed measures to solve the problem of vegetable cir- culation eﬃciency in Wuhan from the perspective of eco- nomical circulation mode and administrative management. Guo [12] used data envelopment model to analyze and evaluate the channel eﬃciency with large supermarket chains as retail terminals. Jiang et al. [13] used analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weight of inﬂuencing factors in vegetable circulation and speciﬁcally analyzed the main inﬂuencing factors in the evaluation results. Jiang [14] constructed the circulation eﬃciency model of vegetables in Beijing suburbs and analyzed the decisive factors aﬀecting the circulation eﬃciency. Zhang [15] conducted an empirical analysis on the circulation eﬃciency of vegetables and an- alyzed the deep-seated factors aﬀecting the circulation ef- ﬁciency of vegetables in China. Kim and An [16] used DEA method to study the technical eﬃciency of rice and vegetable farms. Shrestha et al. [17] used DEA method to evaluate the economic beneﬁts of vegetable farms in Nepal. Shan [18] used data envelopment analysis method to analyze the circulation eﬃciency of real estate vegetables in Harbin from two aspects of input and output and put forward the op- timization path of circulation eﬃciency of real estate veg- etables from four aspects of circulation subject, circulation channel, circulation object, and circulation guarantee measures. Peng and Nan [19] used DEA-Malmquist method to analyze the diﬀerences of vegetable circulation eﬃciency between eastern China and Western China. Zheng [20] measured the circulation eﬃciency of fresh vegetables from the perspective of industrial chain and put forward the promotion strategy. Li and Mu [21] used the DEA Tobit two- stage model to analyze the vegetable circulation eﬃciency of farmers in diﬀerent channels under the wholesale market dominant mode and found that the age of the head of household, the number of years engaged in vegetable pro- duction, the distance between the agricultural product market and home, and whether to join the cooperative are of farmers. Akamin et al. [22] used the stochastic frontier analysis method to estimate the technical eﬃciency of vegetable farmersand testedits inﬂuencingfactors. Anikand Salam [23] estimated the driving factors and technical ef- ﬁciency of okra and eggplant production. Ye [24] used DEA model to evaluate the eﬃciency of main circulation modes of leafy vegetables in Nanchang suburbs. Bournaris et al. [25] used DEA method to evaluate the production eﬃciency of greenhouse vegetables. Nedumaran et al. [26] constructed the fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain model and im- proved the eﬃciency of the fresh vegetable supply chain.",
    "From the existing research results, domestic scholars mainly focus on theoretical research on the current situation and problems of vegetable circulation. On the analysis and evaluation of vegetable circulation eﬃciency, foreign scholarsmainly focus onthe eﬃciency researchin theﬁeld of vegetable production, while domestic researches mostly focus on the eﬃciency research of leading vegetable wholesale market or core vegetable circulation enterprises and take the eﬃciency of leading vegetable wholesale market or core vegetable circulation enterprises as the evaluation standard of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in speciﬁc areas. It has the disadvantage of generalizing. Due to the lack of a perfect statistical index system in China’s vegetable circu- lation industry, the relevant evaluation indexes have the characteristics of small samples, and even some evaluation indexes still have the problem of lack of data. Using tra- ditional methods such as econometric regression to analyze and evaluate the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation may produce large deviation. In addition, the vegetable circu- lation system is a complex system, so it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a suitable function model to analyze the circulation eﬃciency. -e Malmquist index analysis method of data envelopment analysis (DEA) has the advantages of no need to set the function form in advance and being not aﬀected by the number of samples and variable dimensions. It can eﬀec- tively avoid the deviation of the preset model, realize the dynamic cross period measurement of eﬃciency, decompose the Malmquist index, and ﬁnd the reasons for the change of the index. DEA-Malmquist method has become the main- stream method of eﬃciency evaluation. -is paper uses DEA-Malmquist method to analyze and evaluate the eﬃ- ciency of vegetable circulation in Henan Province from both static and dynamic perspectives. On the research of inﬂuencing factors of vegetable cir- culation eﬃciency, the existing research results have refer- ence signiﬁcance for this paper, but little or no consideration has been given to the grey characteristics of inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation, such as partial information known, partial information unknown, and poor informa- tion. GM(1, N) model is one of the grey models considering the inﬂuence of many factors, and it has been widely used and innovated. Ma and Liu [27] constructed a discrete GM(1, N) model to analyze the basic law of oil production decline and the related inﬂuencing factors; Jiang et al. [28] put forward an improved GM(1, N) model to forecast China’s foreign direct investment; Xiong et al. [29] proposed AWGM(1, N) model to predict housing demand; Yang and Li [30] used GM(1, N) model to predict the grain yield in China.-is paper selectsthe grey GM(1, N) model to analyze the inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province, explores the deep-seated reasons of inﬂuencing vegetable circulation eﬃciency, and puts for- ward suggestions for improvement, so as to promote the high-quality development of vegetable circulation industry in Henan Province. At present, the analysis and evaluation methods of com- modity circulation eﬃciency mainly include comprehensive evaluation method, frontier analysis method, and data en- velopment analysis (DEA). -e comprehensive evaluation method is subjective and has some human errors. -e frontier analysis method is suitable for the eﬃciency eval- uation of single output and needs large data samples, while the DEA method is suitable for the eﬃciency evaluation of multiple inputs and multiple outputs. -erefore, DEA method has become the mainstream way of eﬃciency evaluation. 2.1. DEA-BCC Model. CCR model and BCC model are widely used in DEA. Among them, the CCR model assumes that the return to scale of the decision-making unit is ﬁxed, while the BCC model assumes that the return to scale of the decision-making unit is variable. Because there are many subjects to study and it is impossible to achieve the optimal production scale at the same time, and BCC model has the advantage of evaluating the relative technical eﬀectiveness between diﬀerent decision-making units, this paper uses BCC model for eﬃciency analysis and evaluation. Assuming that there are n decision-making units, the BCC model can be expressed as In the above equation, θ is the comprehensive eﬃciency value of the r-th decision-making unit, which can be decomposed into technical eﬃciency and scale eﬃciency; S− and S+ are input slack variables and output slack variables, respectively; λi is the weight of the i-th decision-making unit. When VD�1 and S−�0 and S+�0, then the r-th decision- making unit is DEA eﬃcient. When VD≠1, it means that the r-th decision-making unit is DEA invalid.",
    "2.2.MalmquistIndexModel. In 1953, Malmquist, a Swedish economist and statistician, ﬁrst proposed the Malmquist index model when he studied the consumption problem. After combining with DEA theory, Malmquist index model has been widely used in the ﬁeld of eﬃciency evaluation. Malmquist index focuses on observing the relative changes of multiperiod indexes, which is helpful to analyze the dynamic changes of eﬃciency. -e basis of Malmquist index is distance function, which is the reciprocal of the com- prehensive eﬃciency of BCC model. Malmquist index measures the dynamic change of TFP from t period to t+1 period. Suppose that the distance function Dt(xr t+1, yr t+1) of Malmquist index is obtained by DEA model; then the Malmquist index from t period to t+1 period of the r-th decision-making unit can be expressed as Malmquist index is the change degree of total factor productivity (TFP). When TFP>1, TFP shows an upward trend; TFP�1 indicates that TFP will not change with time. When TFP<1, TFP shows a downward trend. TFP can be decomposed into technical change (TC) and eﬃciency change (EC), and EC can be further decomposed into pure technical eﬃciency (PE) and scale eﬃciency (SE). TC reﬂects the innovation level of technological in- novation and management methods. When TC > 1, it indicates technological progress; otherwise, technology will regress. EC measures whether there is a waste of input factors and whether the resource allocation is optimal. When EC > 1, the technical eﬃciency is im- proved; otherwise, the technical eﬃciency is reduced. SE reﬂects whether the decision-making unit is in the op- timal scale. When SE > 1, it indicates that the evaluation object should expand the scale; otherwise, it should re- duce the scale. PE reﬂects the eﬀective utilization degree of the technology and management of the evaluation object. When PE > 1, it indicates that the pure technical eﬃciency is improved; otherwise, the pure technical ef- ﬁciency is decreased. 2.3. GM(1, N) Model. Although DEA-Malmquist method realizes the measurement and analysis of eﬃciency, it does not get the speciﬁc inﬂuencing factors of eﬃciency, so it is necessary to analyze the speciﬁc inﬂuencing factors of eﬃciency. GM(1, N) model is a diﬀerential equation pre- diction model with ﬁrst-order N variables, which reﬂects the inﬂuence of N−1 inﬂuencing factor variables on the ﬁrst derivative of one system behavior variable. -e characteristic sequence of system behavior can be expressed as Let Xj(1) be the 1-AGO sequence of Xj(0) (j�1, 2, ..., N) and let Z(1) be the nearest neighbor mean generating se- quence of X1 (1); then When the amplitude of change of Xj (1) (j�1, 2, ..., N) is very small, the approximate time response of GM(1, N) is as follows: Based on the relevant research results at home and abroad, considering the validity and availability of sample data and the requirements of DEA model, this paper analyzes and evaluates the vegetable circulation eﬃciency of Henan Province from 2014 to 2019. -e sample data comes from Henan statistical yearbook, and the relevant data from 2014 to 2019 are selected for research. -e number of employees in transportation, warehousing, wholesale, and retail in- dustries has a missing value, which is supplemented by the average value of the years before and after the missing value. commodity circulation and referring to the relevant research results at home and abroad, the vegetable circulation eﬃ- ciency is selected as the explained variable, and then the transportation infrastructure construction (expressed by highway mileage), labor quality (expressed by the number of college graduates), and the quality of labor force (expressed by the number of college graduates) are selected. Industrial structure (expressed by the proportion of the tertiary in- dustry in GDP), consumption capacity (expressed by the total food consumption expenditure of urban residents), informatization level (expressed by the total telecommu- nications business), and government support (expressed by the general public budget expenditure of transportation) are used as explanatory variables to establish a grey GM(1, N) model and analyze the inﬂuencing factors. -e inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency are shown in Table 2. 3.1. Evaluation Index of Vegetable Circulation Eﬃciency in Henan Province. Input indicators are measured from two aspects: labor input X1 (expressed by the total number of employees in transportation, as well as storage and wholesale and retail industries related to vegetable circulation) and capital input X2 (expressed by the total ﬁxed investment in transportation, as well as storage and wholesale and retail industries related to vegetable circulation). -e output index is measured by the total amount of vegetable circulation Y, which is expressed by the total amount of vegetable con- sumption of urban residents. -e evaluation index system of vegetable circulation eﬃciency is shown in Table 1.",
    "3.3.StaticAnalysisofDEAModel. Comprehensive eﬃciency is a comprehensive measure and evaluation of the resource allocation ability and utilization eﬃciency of decision- making units. Pure technical eﬃciency is the production eﬃciency inﬂuenced by management level and technical level, while scale eﬃciency is the production eﬃciency inﬂuenced by production scale. Deap 2.1 software is used to analyze the vegetable circulation eﬃciency of Henan Province in 2014 and 2019, and the comprehensive eﬃciency value, pure technical eﬃciency value, and scale eﬃciency value of vegetable circulation eﬃciency are obtained. -e results are shown in Table 3. 3.2. Factors Inﬂuencing Vegetable Circulation Eﬃciency in Henan Province. In order to further investigate the speciﬁc inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province, according to the relevant theories of eﬃciency of diﬀerent regions. Except for Luoyang, Hebi, Xinxiang, Puyang, Luohe, Nanyang, Shangqiu, Xinyang, and Zhumadian, the comprehensive eﬃ- ciency of other regions is increasing. Pingdingshan and Anyang would reach the production frontier in 2019, which shows that the optimal allocation of resource input in these areas has been realized, the structure is reasonable, and the input-output has reached the optimal eﬀect. Shangqiu, Zhumadian, and Puyang are in the last three places, and the comprehensive eﬃciency values are 0.443, 0.536, and 0.574, respectively. -e main reason is that the technical eﬃciency is too low. -erefore, these areas should pay attention to improving the management level and technical level. technical eﬃciency, which indicates that these cities are more advanced in management and technology, and resources have been fully utilized. -e scale eﬃciency value is the main reason for the low comprehensive eﬃciency of these cities. -ese areas should adjust the investment scale to improve the scale eﬃciency index. 3.4.DynamicAnalysisofMalmquistIndex. Malmquist index can dynamically reﬂect the change trend of the overall ef- ﬁciency of vegetable circulation in Henan Province. -erefore, this paper uses DEAP 2.1 software to analyze and decompose the Malmquist index of 18 cities in Henan Province from 2014 to 2019. -e speciﬁc results are shown in Tables 4 and 5. for the decline of technical eﬃciency in Henan Province lies in the decline of pure technical eﬃ- ciency year by year. Henan Province needs to im- prove the management level and optimize the allocation of resources to promote the improvement ofvegetable circulation eﬃciencyin HenanProvince. 3.5. Analysis of Inﬂuencing Factors of GM(1, N) Model. -is paper measures the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation in Henan Province by Malmquist index analysis method and decomposes the total factor productivity (TFP) index. -e main problem of vegetable circulation in Henan Province is that the management level and technical level are weak, but we do not know the speciﬁc inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province and their inﬂuence degree and direction. It is necessary to further analyze the inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency. Combined with the basic principle of GM(1, N) model, the grey system theory modeling software 7.0 is used to obtain the analysis model of inﬂuencing factors of vegetable cir- culation eﬃciency in Henan Province: -e analysis model of inﬂuencing factors of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province shows that the coeﬃcients of transportation infrastructure construction, consumption capacity, and informatization level are all negative, which indicates that these factors play a reverse role in hindering the improvement of vegetable circulation eﬃciency. -e coeﬃcients of labor quality, industrial structure, and government support are all positive, indi- cating that these factors play a positive role in promoting the circulation eﬃciency of vegetables. -e main reasons are as follows: Henan is a large agricultural province with low urbanization rate, slow rural economic development, weak transportation infrastructure, and unsmooth transportation of agricultural products, which to a certain extent restricts the improvement of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province, and the function coeﬃcient reaches 0.0828. -e consumption ability of urban residents in Henan Province is relatively weak. For example, in the ﬁrst half of 2019, the per capita consumption expenditure of 31 prov- inces in China ranked 25th with 7840 yuan. -e con- sumption level of urban residents is low, which also aﬀects the development of vegetable circulation industry in Henan Province to a certain extent, but the eﬀect is relatively weak, and the eﬀect coeﬃcient is only 0.0003. Informatization is the driving force for the development of modern circulation industry, and the level of informatization also aﬀects the improvement of vegetable circulation eﬃciency to a certain extent. For a long time, the development level of informa- tization in Henan Province is relatively backward, which hinders the improvement of vegetable circulation eﬃciency in Henan Province, but the eﬀect is very weak, and the eﬀect coeﬃcient is only 0.0001.",
    "has a good eﬀect in industrial structure optimization and management level improvement. -e technical eﬃciency of Henan Province during 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 was greater than 1, and the average technical eﬃciency during 2014–2019 was 0.995, which indicates that the vegetable circulation in Henan Province has high regulation and in- novation ability. During 2015-2016 and 2018-2019, vegetable circulation industry in Henan Province has a high technological progress index, which indicates that Henan Province has a high technological innovation ability. the From 2014 to 2019, the vegetable circulation productivity indexin mostareasofHenanProvincewas lessthan1, which indicates that the vegetable circulation eﬃciency presents a downward trend, and the vegetable circulation eﬃciency in 10 areas presents a downward trend, which is the result of the synchronous decline of the technical progress index and the technical eﬃciency index. However, the pure technical eﬃciency index and scale eﬃciency index of 11 regions were greater than 1, which indicates that these regions have good eﬀects in the optimization of industrial structure, the im- provement of management level, and the innovation of circulation technology. 4.2. Suggestion. In terms of capital investment, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Nanyang, Xinyang, and Zhoukou are in the stage of increasing returns to scale. Increasing the investment of capital elements appropriately in order to improve the ef- ﬁciency of vegetable circulation is suggested. Excessive capital input may lead to waste of resources. Kaifeng, Hebi, Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, Puyang, Xuchang, Luohe, Sanmenxia, Shangqiu, Zhumadian, and Jiyuan are in the stage of di- minishing returns to scale. It is suggested that capital input should be reduced to improve the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation. 4.1.Conclusion. From 2014 to 2019, the vegetable circulation productivity of Henan Province was on the rise. During 2014-2015 and 2016-2017, the pure technical eﬃciency of vegetable circulation in Henan Province was relatively high, and the average value of pure technical eﬃciency during 2014–2019 was 0.993, which indicates that there are some innovations in vegetable circulation technology in Henan Province. -e vegetable circulation in Henan Province has a higher scale eﬃciency value during 2014-2015 and 2017–2019, and the average scale eﬃciency during 2014–2019 was 1.002, which indicates that Henan Province Transportation Infrastructure Construction. -e construc- tion of transportation infrastructure plays an important role in promoting vegetable transportation. A perfect trans- portation network can speed up the circulation of vegetables and increase the circulation of vegetables. Henan Province should increase the investment and construction of vege- table circulation infrastructure, improve the transportation system, build eﬃcient and convenient transportation in- frastructure network, reduce the circulation cost, and im- prove the vegetable circulation speed. Consumption Ability. -e consumption ability of residents is the basic power to improve the eﬃciency of vegetable cir- culation. -e increase of disposable income of urban resi- dents canincrease their purchasing power, promote the scale of vegetable circulation, and improve the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation. Henan Province should formulate relevant policies to improve the wage level of enterprise employees and establish a normal wage growth mechanism. At the same time, the government should strengthen macro control, restrain the ﬂuctuation of vegetable prices, stabilize the consumptionexpectations of urbanresidents, and relieve the worries of consumption. ?e Level of Informatization. Informatization is the driving force and symbol of the development of modern circulation industry. -e speed of information dissemination deter- mines the circulation speed and quality of vegetables. To improve the circulation speed of vegetables in Henan Province, we need to speed up the construction of vegetable information service and improve the vegetable information service network. Henan Province should promote the opening and sharing of vegetable circulation information, build a public information platform for vegetable circula- tion, promote the eﬀective connection between various links of vegetable circulation in Henan Province through platform services, promote the optimal allocation of resources, and improve the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation. Labor Quality. High-quality vegetable circulation human capital can improve the quality and level of vegetable cir- culation service, reduce the cost of circulation management, and promote the improvement of circulation eﬃciency. Henan Province should pay attention to the introduction of vegetable circulation management personnel and technical personnel and, at the same time, strengthen the training of employees to improve their vocational skills. Industrial Structure. Industrial structure is the proportion of output value of vegetable circulation related industries in GDP, which reﬂects the development of vegetable circula- tion industry in the region. Most of the vegetable circulation related industries belong to the tertiary industry, such as the developed wholesale and retail of agricultural products, which will create a good external environment for the de- velopment of vegetable circulation industry. Henan Prov- ince should vigorously develop the tertiary industry, promotethe optimizationofindustrial structure,prosper the market economy, and promote the development of vegetable circulation industry.",
    "?e Degree of Government Support. -e degree of govern- ment support for vegetable circulation is an important guarantee to improve the eﬃciency of vegetable circulation. Henan Province should pay attention to the planning of vegetable circulation industry, promote the rational dis- tribution of vegetable wholesale market, and improve the ﬁnancial and tax policies related to vegetable circulation, such as giving preferential policies in land use, tax, and loans. Bingjun Li was responsible for proposing the overall idea and framework of the manuscript. Xueqiang Guo was re- sponsible for data processing and writing of the ﬁrst draft of the manuscript."
