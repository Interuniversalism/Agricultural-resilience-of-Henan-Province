GM (1, N) model is one of the grey prediction models considering the inﬂuence of many factors. -is paper improves GM (1, N) model and constructs PSO-GM (1, N) model. Firstly, Lasso method is used to select the inﬂuencing factors, then the priority of inﬂuencing factors and the value of parameter N in GM (1, N) model are determined, and ﬁnally PSO method is used to optimize GM (1, N) model. Taking the vegetable supply in Henan Province as the research object, this paper makes an empirical test by using PSO-GM (1, N) model. -e results show that the key factors aﬀecting the vegetable supply in Henan Province are the number of rural employees, highway mileage, and application of pesticide. -e vegetable supply in Henan Province will continue to show a steady growth trend in the next three years. Vegetables are essential agricultural products in the daily life of urban and rural residents. Eﬀectively ensuring the supply of vegetables has become a great event related to people’s livelihood. Vegetable supply is aﬀected by many factors such as natural climate, production capacity, and transportation. Eﬀectively identifying the key factors aﬀecting vegetable supply and accurately predicting the future vegetable supply are of great practical signiﬁcance for stabilizing vegetable market supply and stabilizing vegetable price ﬂuctuation. Scholars have studied the inﬂuencing factors analysis and prediction model construction of vegetable supply from diﬀerent angles. Wu and Mu [1] found that the urban population has the greatest impact on the circulation of vegetables; Hu et al. [2] analyzed the impact of agricultural informatization on vegetable yield; Yu [3] found that the main factors aﬀecting vegetable production are planting area, vegetable consumption, and agricultural ﬁnancial ex- penditure; Yang and Sun [4] found that the main factors aﬀecting vegetable yield are economic development, tech- nical investment, and land; Li and Mu [5] analyzed the impact of ﬁnancial capital on Farmers’ willingness to con- tinue planting vegetables; Yin [6] constructed a wavelet neural network prediction model and predicted tomato yield; Qiao ad Liu [7] analyzed the impact of the aging of vegetable farmers on vegetable yield. Jin et al. [8] analyzed the role of logistics service providers in detail. From the existing research results, scholars mainly focus on the ﬁeld of vegetable production, which cannot completely reﬂect the whole process of vegetable supply. Scholars rarely or even did not consider the grey characteristics of some known information, some unknown information, and poor infor- mation of the inﬂuencing factors of vegetable supply. In addition, when constructing the prediction model, the multicollinearity and overﬁtting between the inﬂuencing factors are not considered deeply. When considering the inﬂuence of multiple factors, Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method can eliminate those un- important factors from many inﬂuencingfactors, select a few important factors that have a signiﬁcant impact on the system, and eﬀectively eliminate the problems of multi- collinearity and overﬁtting. GM (1, N) model is one of the grey prediction models considering the inﬂuence of many factors. In view of the large error of the grey prediction model in practical application, this paper proposes an im- proved PSO-GM (1, N) model, which provides a new way to study the prediction of vegetable supply. For a multifactor prediction problem, let X0 � (x0(1), x0(2),...,x0(n)) be the system characteristic data sequence, and Xi � (xi(1),xi(2),...,xi(n)) be the inﬂuencing factor sequence. In order to eliminate the multicollinearity problem of relevant inﬂuencing factors, PSO-GM (1, N) ﬁrst screens the relevant inﬂuencing factors by Lasso method, then determines the priority of inﬂuencing factors and the value of parameter N in GM (1, N) model, that is, the second selection of relevant inﬂuencing factors, and ﬁnally opti- mizes GM (1, N) model by PSO method. j�1 |βj| is the regularization function, and λ is the adjustment parameter, also known as regularization parameter; it is mainly used to balance loss function and regularization function. When λ (λ≥0) is increasing gradually from 0, the regularization function can set the estimated values of some coeﬃcients to zero, so as to eliminate the corresponding variables and achieve the purpose of variable selection. -e value of λ is determined by cross validation, that is, one part of the inﬂuencing factor sample data is selected as the training set and the other part is selected as the validation set, and diﬀerent models are generated under the same training set. When the error of the veriﬁcation set in these models is the smallest, at this time, λ is selected. Using Lasso method, if m main inﬂuencing factors are selected from s inﬂuencing factors, i.e., the inﬂuencing factor set is screened for the ﬁrst time, it can be recorded as Xi′(i � 1,2,...,m).",
    "2.1. Lasso Method. Lasso is a regularized compression es- timation method proposed by statistician Robert Tibshirani in 1996. Regularization is a strategic method that can constrain the characteristics of the model and prevent overﬁtting. Based on the loss function of the least squares (ordinary least square (OLS)), Lasso uses the sum of the absolute values of the regression coeﬃcients as a penalty function to compress the regression coeﬃcients. When the sum of the absolute values of the regression coeﬃcients is small enough, some regression coeﬃcients can be com- pressed to zero, and then the variables with zero coeﬃcients can be eliminated, so as to achieve the eﬀect of variable selection [9]. Assumed linear regression model X0 � βX + ε, where X0 isthe system behavior characteristic vector, Xis the inﬂuence factor variable matrix, and β is the coeﬃcient vector, then the coeﬃcient estimation of Lasso method is as follows: 2.2. Priority of Inﬂuencing Factors. Based on the set of inﬂuencing factors selected for the ﬁrst time, Deng’s grey relational analysis model is used to determine the priority of each inﬂuencing factor. Due to the diﬀerent dimensionless processing methods of the original data, it has diﬀerent eﬀects on the grey correlation order of the inﬂuencing factors. Here, this paper uses six processing methods, i.e., ① initial value, ② average value, ③ minimization, ④ maxi- mization, ⑤ centralization, and ⑥ diﬀerence. Because the correlation order is reﬂected in the diﬀer- ence of the inﬂuence factors on the system behavior, and the more obvious the diﬀerence is, the better the reasonable correlation order is selected based on the following prin- ciples. Suppose six dimensionless processing methods are used to get the correlation degree of inﬂuencing factors as ri k(i � 1,2,...,m,k � 1,2,...,6). On the premise of small amount of calculation, two principles are proposed to judge the reasonable correlation order [10]: For the inﬂuencing factor sequence Xi′(i � 1,2,...,m), according to the above principles, the reasonable correlation order of inﬂuencing factors can be determined. For con- venience of expression, it is recorded here as follows: 2.3.1. GM (1, N) Model. GM (1, N) model is a first-order differential equation prediction model with N variables, which reflects the influence of N—1 influencing factor var- iables on the first derivative of one system behavior variable. In order to be consistent with the traditional GM (1, N) model representation method, the corresponding system behavior characteristic sequence and the influencing factor sequence selected and determined for the first time are reexpressed as follows: , (j � 1,2, j j ...,N), and Z(1) be the nearest neighbor mean generating sequence of X(1) 1 , then When of amplitude the change X(1) , (j � 1,2,...,N), is very small, the approximate time j of response of GM (1, N) is as follows: 2.3.2. Determination of N Value in GM (1, N) Model. At present, GM (1, N) model has been widely used and in- novated. Ma and Liu [11] proposed discrete GM (1, N) model and analyzed the basic law of oil production decline and the inﬂuence of related factors; Fan [12] proposed an improved GM (1, N) soybean price forecasting model; Xie et al. [13] proposed the GICM model, screened the key indicators of complex products, and improved the predic- tion accuracy of GM (1, N) model; Ren [14] used GM (1, N) method to model anaerobic digestion system and predict methane production; Zeng et al. [15] proposed a new multivariable grey prediction GM (1, N) model; Xiong et al. [16] improvedGM (1, N)model and proposedAWGM(1, N) model to predict housing demand; Yang and Liu [17] used GM (1, N) model to predict China’s grain output; Cheng et al. [18] established grey GM (1, 3) model to simulate and predict the main inﬂuencing factors of clean energy con- sumption; Zhang [19] analyzed the inﬂuencing factors of ginger planting area from the aspects of economy, input, and output and established a grey prediction model. In order to test the accuracy of the prediction results of the model, the last three samples are selected from the n sample of the system as the comparison value of the pre- diction results of the model, and the model is established by using n—3 sample data. Through the test of the prediction effect, the optimal N value is determined. The specific steps are as follows: In Step 1, based on the reexpression of influencing factor sequence in relation (5) and 2.3.1, select x! , establish GM (1, 2) model, and predict the three periods of n—2, n—1, and n. Through comparing with the actual value and calculating the average relative error, the result is recorded as &.",
    "In Step 2, according to the above method and the correlation order of inﬂuencing factors determined in re- lation (5), the GM (1, 3) model, GM (1, 4) model,...,GM (1, N) model are established, respectively, and the average relative errors are calculated, which are recorded as ε3,ε4,...,εN. In Step 3, when εi(i � 2,3,...,N) is the minimum, the prediction accuracy of the model is the highest. In this case, the value of i is the optimal solution, that is, the GM (1, i) model is the optimal prediction model. From the existing research results, no scholar has studied the value of parameter N in GM (1, N) model. -is paper proposes a method to determine the value of the parameter N in GM (1, N) model: according to the correlation order of 2.3.3. PSO-GM (1, N) Prediction Model. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) initializes a group of random particles and then ﬁnds the optimal value through multiple iterations. In each iteration, each particle updates its speed and position through the individual extreme pbest and global extreme gbest. -e calculation formula is as follows: where vk is the current velocity of the particle, xk is the current position of the particle, pbestk is the position of the optimal value currently found by the particle, and gbestk is the position of the optimal value currently found by the whole population. w is the inertia weight, c1, c2 is the ac- celeration coeﬃcient, usually c1 � c2 � 2. r1, r2 is a random number between (0, 1). -rough continuous updating, particles ﬁnally reach the position of the global optimal value. According to the basic principle of GM (1, N) model, let u � (a,b1,b2,...,bn−1)T; the calculation formula u � (BTB)−1BY, where is It can be seen that the representation of GM (1, N) model depends on matrix B. -e estimated value of the parameter u is obtained according to the above method, but it is not necessarily optimal. In this paper, PSO-GM (1, N) model is proposed: add other parameters to matrix B, and then use particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal parameter u. Matrix B with parameters is reexpressed as follows: -en, the parameter (a,b1,b2,...,bn−1)T is reestimated according to formula u � (BTB)−1BY, the parameter in (a,b1,b2,...,bn−1)T is a function of ki(i � 1,2,...,N), and GM (1, N) is also a function of ki(i � 1,2,...,N). According to the optimal prediction model GM (1, N) determined in 2.3.2, the relative errors of the model in three periods of n−2, n−1, and n are calculated, respectively: ε(n − 2), ε(n − 1), and ε(n). -e minimum average relative error in these three periods is taken as the objective function of particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is specif- ically expressed as follows: 3.1.DataSourcesandInﬂuencingFactors. Due to thelack ofa perfect statistical index system for agricultural products logistics, this paper selects the product of the number of urban residents and the per capita fresh vegetable purchase of urban residents in Henan Province from 2007 to 2019 as the vegetable supply (X0) and uses the predicted value of vegetable supply (X0) to reﬂect the development and change of vegetable supply in Henan Province in the future. According to the existing research results and the principles of comprehensiveness, representativeness, and operability of index selection, 9 inﬂuencing factors are selected: vegetable planting area (X1) (thousand hectares), the application amount of pesticide (X2) (10 thousand tons), the usage of plastic ﬁlm (X3) (10 thousand tons), plastic ﬁlm coverage area (X4) (thousand hectares), the number of rural em- ployees (X5) (10 thousand people), the investment in transportation, storage, and postal industry (X6) (100 million RMB), highway mileage (X7) (10 thousand km), the tonnage of road truck (X8) (10 thousand tons), and the number of employees in highway transportation industry (X9) (people). -e data in this paper are all from the statistical yearbook of Henan Province. 3.2.1. Determination of the First Inﬂuencing Factor Set. Based on the inﬂuence factor set selected in 3.1, this paper takes the sample data of inﬂuence factors from 2007 to 2016 as the training set and uses Lasso method to determine the inﬂuence factors with the help of MATLAB software. -e minimum error value can be obtained by iterating the program for 8 times. -e factors corresponding to the nonzero term in the regression coeﬃcient are the selection results of Lasso method. -e speciﬁc results are shown in Table 1.",
    "3.2.2. Priority of Inﬂuencing Factors Selected for the First Time. According to the inﬂuence factor set selected for the ﬁrst time, the method established in 2.2 is used for pro- cessing, and the speciﬁc calculation results are shown in Table 2. According to the judgment criteria (3) and criteria (4), the ideal correlation order of inﬂuencing factors is obtained after the initial value processing method: 3.2.3. Determination of N Value in GM (1, N) Model. For expression (13), the method determined in 2.3.2 is used for processing, and the results are shown in Table 3. Because ε4 (4.93%) is the minimum value of εi(i � 2,3,...,N), so N�4, that is, the inﬂuencing factors of the second selection 3.2.4. Prediction Results of PSO-GM (1, N) Model and Analysis of Inﬂuencing Factors. -e PSO-GM (1, N) model established in 2.3.3 is used to predict the vegetable supply in Henan Province from 2017 to 2019, in which the number of particles is 100, the inertia weight is 1, the acceleration coeﬃcient is 2, and the number of iterations is 1000. After many experiments and based on the sample data from 2010 to 2016, the average relative error of vegetable supply in Henan Province from 2017 to 2019 is the smallest, reaching 2.38%. In order to compare the rationality of the prediction results, PSO-GM (1, 4) model, GM (1, 4) model, GM (1, 1) model, and multiple linear regression method are used to predict the vegetable supply in Henan Province. -e actual value of vegetable supply in Henan Province from 2017 to 2019 is taken as the standard. -e results are shown in Table 4. It can be seen from Table 4 that the average relative error from high to low is PSO-GM (1, 4) model, GM (1, 4) model, GM (1, 1) model, and multiple linear regression. It can be concluded that compared with the traditional GM (1, N) model, PSO-GM (1, N) model greatly improves the prediction accuracy and is much higher than other According to the result of 3.2.3, PSO-GM (1, 4) model is used to forecast the vegetable supply in Henan Province in the next three years. -e results are shown in Table 5. -e data of inﬂuencing factors in the next three years are ob- tained by GM (1, 1) model, and the results are shown in Table 6. It can be concluded from Table 5 that the vegetable supply in Henan Province will still show a steady growth trend in the next three years, and it is expected to reach 6.35 million tons in 2023. -e key factors aﬀecting the vegetable supply in Henan Province are the number of rural employees, highway mileage, and pesticide application. Among them, the number of rural employees and road mileage has a positive impact on vegetable supply, while the application amount of pesticides has a negative impact on vegetable supply. Vegetable production is a labor-intensive industry; the number of labor has a direct impact on vegetable produc- tion. With the development of social economy, agricultural machinery has greatly improved labor productivity, but in vegetable production, due to the limitations of vegetable types and terrain, agricultural machinery is diﬃcult to get eﬀective application and still needs a lot of labor for manual operation. -erefore, the impact of rural employment on vegetable supply is positive. the second time. Finally, the PSO method is used to optimize the GM (1, N) model, which greatly improves the prediction accuracy. Based on PSO-GM (1, N) model, the vegetable supply in Henan Province in the next three years is pre- dicted. -e results show that the vegetable supply in Henan Province continues to show an increasing trend. -e key factors aﬀecting vegetable supply in Henan Province are the number of rural employees, highway mileage, and appli- cation of pesticide. -e PSO-GM (1, N) model proposed in this paper provides a new method for multifactor grey prediction. However,this study doesnot consider the impact of adjacent provinces on vegetable supply in Henan Prov- ince, especially spatial autocorrelation. Next, the temporal and spatial evolution law of vegetable supply in Henan Province will be explored from the two dimensions of time and space. -e modes of freight transportation include road transportation, railway transportation, waterway trans- portation, and air transportation. Due to the characteristics of short distance transportation of vegetables, highway transportation is widely used in vegetable transportation. Transportation infrastructure construction plays an im- portant role in promoting vegetable transportation. Perfect traﬃcnetwork can speed up the circulation ofvegetables and expand the scale of vegetable market. Highway mileage is an important indicator of regional traﬃc infrastructure. -erefore, the impact of highway mileage on vegetable supply is positive.",
    "-e excessive pesticide residue in vegetables is an im- portant task in the supervision of vegetable quality and safety. In the process of vegetable production, due to the frequent occurrence of diseases and insect pests, farmers have overdose in vegetable production in order to ensure vegetable yield. Due to the strict control of government departments, the supply of vegetable market has decreased signiﬁcantly. In order to stabilize the normal supply of vegetable market, it is urgent to reduce the use of pesticides. -erefore, the eﬀect of pesticide application on vegetable supply is negative.
