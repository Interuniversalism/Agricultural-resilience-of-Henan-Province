            "In response to low birth rates and an aging population, China enacted a universal two-child policy in 2016 that was further liberalized to a three-child policy in 2021 [15]. Subsequently, the second-child fertility rate rose significantly from 0.6 before 2011 to over 1.0 in 2017 [16]. According to the seventh national population cen- sus, second and third children accounted for 43.08% and 9.02% of all births, as many Chinese families transition from one-child families to multi-child families [17]. Over the past few decades, strict family planning policies have alleviated gender inequality by controlling family size, but recent changes in fertility policies have created new challenges for multi-child families, notably in vaccination coverage [18, 19]. A study in Zhejiang Province demon- strated that inequalities in full primary immunization (FPI) coverage were attributable to birth order but not sex [20]. In contrast, non-NIP vaccines are voluntarily received at family expense, uneven allocation of house- hold resources in multi-child families and sex preferences could be important, emerging barriers to promoting non- NIP vaccine equity in China [21-23]. However, little is known about the combined effects of sex and birth order on non-national immunization program (non-NIP) vac- cines globally, and particularly in China under the rela- tively recent three-child policy [24-26]. Our study examined the independent and joint asso- ciations of sex and birth order with non-NIP vaccina- tion coverage among children aged 1-6 years in China and explored whether associations varied by family socio-demographics. The design was a cross-sectional survey of children with accompanying parents/guardians that was conducted in Zhejiang and Henan provinces between July 2022 and October 2022. We used a multi-stage sampling method to recruit children and their caregivers. Five towns/commu- nities were selected in Song County of Henan Province and Xiaoshan District of Zhejiang Province by simple random sample. Community health services centers and township health centers were study sites. In the centers, we approached and invited parents/guardians bringing children 1-6 years of age for vaccination at the health center to participate in the survey. The lower age limit of the children was one year because all five of the non- NIP vaccines that we used to assess vaccination status should have their first dose administered during the first year of life. Children and their caregivers were included if (1) they have been local residents for >6 months; (2) caregivers had no severe physical or mental health condi- tions; and (3) the accompanying child had no contrain- dications to vaccination. Trained interviewers conducted face-to-face questionnaire-based surveys of caregivers who consented to the study. The target sample size for the survey was based on his- torical coverage levels and desired precision. Using the historical childhood vaccination coverage of non-NIP vaccines of 75.8% and a desired precision of +2% with 95% confidence intervals, and assuming a non-response rate of up to 10.0%, the required number of caregiver with child participants was 1937. The caregiver questionnaire was based on factors known to influence caregiver attitudes towards vaccination. The initial draft of the questionnaire was reviewed by public health experts and immunization providers and modified according to experts feedback and comments. The survey instrument was then pilot tested and further refined. The final questionnaire had five sections: (1) characteristics of the children, including age, sex, place of residence, birth order, and primary caregiver; (2) characteristics of car- egivers, including age, sex, education, and annual house- hold income; and (3) vaccination status of five non-NIP vaccines—Haemophilus influenza b (Hib) vaccine, vari- cella vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, enterovirus 71 vaccine (EV71), and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV 13). The primary outcome of our study was coverage of the non-NIP vaccines. Vaccination status was assessed in the questionnaire by asking caregivers to show their chil- dren’s vaccination card. Based on the coverage of differ- ent numbers of vaccines (Table $3), nearly half (49.0%) of children received at least one dose of three or more of the five non-NIP vaccines; for easy interpretation and com- parison, this group were considered vaccinated in the logistic regression; children who received zero, one, or two of the vaccines were considered unvaccinated. Inde- pendent variables were sex and birth order of children. Birth order was coded as first-born, second-born and third-born or later, with first-born children as the refer- ence group. Boys were the reference group for the inde- pendent variable, sex.\n",

            "From the values of Malmquist measure, the four urban areas of Pingdingshan, Xinxiang, Nanyang and Anyang have the highest efficiency of financial support for economic development, the reasons for their growth are discussed in depth and detail. In recent 7 years, the efficiency of financial support to the economy in Pingdingshan City has grown by 28.5% in the last 7 years, including 19.3% in technical efficiency, 7.7% in technology level, and 18.7% in technical scale efficiency, thanks to the economic transformation strategy of a single development model and economic model. In order to revitalize the economy, Pingdingshan began to adjust the industrial layout and carry out supply-side reform. In the aspect of finance, it has increased financial innovation, made continuous improvement and exploration on rural industrial revitalization, improved the financial organization system, increased the number of financial institutions and the number of financial practitioners; In terms of rural revitalization, credit loans should be increased, inclusive financial service stations should be set up, and the speed of financial capital circulation should be increased. In the past 7 years, the economic efficiency of financial support in Xinxiang increased by 26.2%, including 16.3% in technical efficiency, 8.5% in technology level and 18% in scale efficiency. In finance, Xinxiang City is committed to expanding the number of capital loans, carry forward the functional role of the bank's own business; expanding the opening of the financial sector, developing and growing financial subjects; improving the ability of our country's finance to amplify the effect of capital and innovating the structure of government financial institutions, making the scale and technical level of finance grow at a faster rate year by year and supporting the efficiency of economic development steadily. The efficiency of financial support to the economy in Nanyang City has grown 23.3% in the past 7 years, including 2% growth in technical efficiency, 20.9% growth in technical level and 1.8% growth in scale efficiency. In recent years, Nanyang City has been constantly improving the quality and speed of economic development, trying its best to create a good financial ecological atmosphere, implementing strategies to make the total amount of social investment rise, and laying a solid foundation for realizing the steady development of finance. In addition, Nanyang City combines the city's ecological advantages to develop green finance and ensure the high quality of economic development. The efficiency of financial support to the economy in Anyang City has increased by 23% in the past 7 years, including 13.7% in technical efficiency, 8.2% in technology level and 14.3% in scale efficiency. Since the \"13th Five-Year Plan\", Anyang City began to reform the internal structure of finance, sink rural financial institutions and improve the level of rural financial services. In addition, Anyang City has tightened its grasp on financial risk for prevention and control, increased innovation, and promoted the bank multi-guarantee cooperation, improved the efficiency of lending, accelerated the circulation of funds. With the increasing financial support This paper adopts the universally applicable DEA- Malmquist method and makes the number of financial employment and bank loan balance of each urban area in Henan Province from 2013 to 2019 the input variables in terms of input indicators and the GDP value Y of each region in Henan Province the output variable of the decision unit tocalculate efficiency of financial support for economic operation and development in each region of Henan Province. The results show that the overall efficiency of financial service economy in each urban area of Henan Province has increased in the past seven years. What’s more, the highest rate of increase is Pingdingshan, followed by Xinxiang, Nanyang, Anyang, Kaifeng, Sanmenxia and Zhengzhou. Moreover, the improvement of technology level is the main factor for the increase of efficiency, which indicates that the key to economic growth in all regions of China is the technological development level of enterprises. Through the above analysis, the efficiency of financial support for economic development of all cities in Henan Province has been advancing steadily in the past 7 years. In order to better respond to the new strategy of national high-quality economic development and establish a new pattern of double-cycle economic development. Henan Province should timely grasp the essence of the new era of economic development stage and adjust the pace of the new development pattern. Therefore, the following suggestions are proposed: Financial innovation injects fresh blood into the long-term development and improvement of the financial industry. Henan Province should formulate innovative monetary policies for the urban and rural economy of prefectures and cities, strengthen cooperation and contact with financial entities, and tightly grasp the innovation work from top to bottom; The financial industry should actively explore, increase service innovation, and enrich the types and quantity of financial entities. For example, opening precise poverty alleviation rural banks, improve the efficiency of financial services; innovate the internal structure of finance, develop business in the offline real financial field, increase the popularity of online financial service platforms by using their convenience; provide targeted financial services, flexibly adjust deposit and loan interest rates, deposit reserve rates and rediscounting, and improve the level of financial technology. Develop business in the offline real financial field, increase the popularity of online financial service platforms by using their convenience, and improve the level of financial technology; provide targeted financial services, flexibly adjust deposit and loan interest rates, deposit reserve ratio and rediscount rate, solve diverse financial problems, and improve the innovation consciousness and income level of service recipients.\n",

            "We searched for the keyword ‘COVID-19’ in the hot search on microblog and limited the time between January 29, 2020, and March 30, 2020. A Python web crawler was used to crawl the content of blog posts; due to the large number of microblogs during the period, we set the crawling rules when writing the crawler program by specifying the step length of page-turning crawling to 3. We then performed data cleaning by (i) removing null data, invalid data, and duplicate data; and (ii) conducting a fuzzy search for data containing words such as “news” and “daily” in the blogger’s name field, and deleting such data because official microblogs mainly publish information about newly confirmed cases and epidemic prevention and control policies and there is a lot of duplication. Finally, 7560 valid data points were retained, which were further divided into two categories: positive emotions and negative emotions. The training set, verification set, and test set were divided according to the ratio of 8:1:1. The experiments in this paper were based on Tensor-flow deep learning framework. First, we downloaded the pre-trained BERT model from Google (Chinese_L-12_vcH-768_A-12), and then pre-processed the data set. Since BERT is based on Transformer with self-attention being its basic component, it can extract important information according to the weights assigned to different features by the attention mechanism and form a new lexicon in the sentiment field of COVID-19 while completing the sentiment classification task. Word2vec and BERT were used as comparative experiments. Finally, the effectiveness of our model is evaluated by extracting parameters from the confusion matrix, namely, precision, recall, and accuracy. The confusion matrix contains four terms: True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN). For a given class c, which could be either positive or negative, ¢ represents the corresponding opposite class. The TP represents the number of reviews of class c that were correctly classified as class c, whereas the FP indicates the number of reviews of class ¢ that were incorrectly classified as class c. Also, TN depicts the number of reviews of class ¢ that were correctly classified as ¢, whereas FN represents the number of reviews of class c that were erroneously classified as ¢. Precision quantifies the exactness of a model and is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted reviews (TP) to the total number of predicted reviews (TP + FP) in any class c, where c may be positive or negative class. The formula of precision is Recall computes the completeness of a model and is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted reviews (TP) to the total number of actual reviews (TP + FN) in any class c, where c may be positive or negative. The formula of recall is Accuracy evaluates the correctness of a model and is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted to the total number of reviews, which is Table 1 shows the comparison of the evaluation criteria of different models, which indicates that the performance of BERT is more superior. Through the analysis of the COVID-19 field lexicon, we find that the main negative sentiments are expressed as follows. The main positive sentiments are mainly manifested in three aspects: the effective prevention and control of COVID-19, the support of medical staff and volunteers from various places in the hardest-hit areas, and the free opening of various resources by the state, which we further discuss as follows. Among them, negative sentiments mainly stem from the public’s panic about the situation of COVID-19 and the shortage of medical re- sources, followed by the impact of lockdown and isolation on life. In the positive sentiments, there are many vocabularies about the national medical staff supporting Wuhan, and joint efforts to fight the epidemic are the main source of the residents’ positive sentiments. During the epidemic, effective prevention and control policies such as strict isola- tion, wearing masks, shelter hospitals, effective rescue, supporting living measures, strong execution, and daily publication of epidemic infor- mation, have an important impact on the sentiment trend of residents. Besides, the support and unity of all parties in the face of difficulties to jointly fight the epidemic are the key measures to achieve significant results in the prevention and control of the epidemic.\n",

            "It is crucial to solve the issues of insufficient technology and functionality on e-commerce platforms to drive the development of cross-border e-commerce and enhance enterprise competitiveness. By strengthening payment security technology, improving cross-border marketing tools, and implementing other measures, enterprises can effectively enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of their online operations, fostering the healthy development of the industry. The lack of professional talent in the field of cross-border e-commerce is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed urgently. The rapid development and complexity of cross- border e-commerce pose challenges for enterprises in recruiting and cultivating professional talent. This situation is mainly manifested in the following aspects: Scarcity of Professional Talent: There is a shortage of professional talent in areas such as international trade knowledge, overseas market development capabilities, and digital marketing skills. Insufficient Training for Existing Talent: Even if enterprises have recruited a certain number of professional talents, they often require further training and improvement in practical work. The lack of a systematic training plan and continuous professional training makes it difficult for existing talent to quickly adapt to and master the requirements of cross-border e-commerce operations and management. To address these issues, effective measures can be taken, such as establishing a comprehensive talent cultivation system for cross-border e-commerce. This includes improving relevant professional courses, implementing practical teaching and internship programs, and enhancing the practical operational capabilities of talents. Strengthening cooperation between enterprises and universities, training institutions, etc., to jointly carry out cross-border e-commerce talent training programs, can also enhance employees! professional skills and competitiveness. Governments and industry organizations should also formulate corresponding policies to encourage and support enterprises in conducting talent cultivation work, thereby improving the talent supply level in the field of cross-border e-commerce. Risk management in cross-border e-commerce platforms is a critical issue that enterprises must highly prioritize, encompassing compliance risks, information security risks, operational risks, as well as market risks and financial risks, among others. Enterprises need to establish a comprehensive risk management system and response mechanism to effectively address various potential risk challenges. Research indicates that the risks faced by cross-border e- commerce platforms mainly involve compliance, information security, market demand fluctuations, and financial crises. Compliance risk refers to the possibility of enterprises violating laws, regulations, or policies in cross-border operations, leading to penalties or litigation risks. Information security risks include issues such as information leakage and data theft, which may result in customer privacy exposure or financial losses. Additionally, there are market risks and financial risks, caused respectively by fluctuations in market demand and issues like the breakdown of funding chains or financial fraud. To effectively address these risks, enterprises can take various measures. This includes establishing a robust risk management system, which involves clearly defining risk responsibility, establishing assessment mechanisms, conducting regular audits, etc. Strengthening information security protection by using secure encryption technologies, establishing data backup mechanisms, etc., to ensure information security. Simultaneously, actively conducting compliance training, strengthening internal management, and raising employees' awareness of compliance and risk prevention.[5] The establishment of comprehensive cross-border e- commerce laws and regulations is crucial for the healthy development of the industry. With the rapid growth of cross- border e-commerce, well-developed regulations not only provide stable legal foundations and business environments for enterprises but also effectively regulate market order, protect consumer rights, and promote sustainable industry growth. In the field of cross-border e-commerce, comprehensive laws and regulations need to cover several aspects. This includes clarifying transaction rules to ensure the legitimate rights of both parties, including the signing, execution, and dispute resolution mechanisms of transaction contracts. Additionally, clear tax policies are needed to provide tax guidance for enterprises, reduce tax risks, and promote healthy business development. Furthermore, it is necessary to strengthen intellectual property protection, combat infringement activities, and encourage innovation and legal operation of intellectual property. Establishing comprehensive cross-border e-commerce laws and regulations helps to create a fair competitive market environment, reduce legal risks, enhance enterprise confidence, attract more investors to participate in the cross- border e-commerce field, and promote the industry's healthy development. Strengthening compliance supervision of cross-border e- commerce platforms is crucial as it safeguards market order and consumer rights. According to research from the International Business Law Review, cross-border e- commerce platforms, as key participants in the market, directly impact the healthy development of the entire industry and consumer confidence through compliance supervision. Regulatory authorities should take measures to ensure To effectively enhance supervision, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive regulatory system and mechanism. This includes formulating clear regulatory rules and standards, establishing effective supervision and inspection mechanisms, and enhancing cooperation with industry organizations and enterprises. Additionally, regulatory authorities should strengthen information disclosure and transparency, promptly releasing regulatory information and penalty results to enhance the visibility and effectiveness of supervision.\n",

The editorial history of this article is available here: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0318441 Non-grain conversions (NGC) of cultivated land pose a great threat to national food secu- rity, and farmers are the direct actors in the NGC of cultivated land. Exploring the influence of farmer’ survival situation on their willingness to convert cultivated land to non-grain land can provide theoretical support for formulating control policies for NGC of cultivated land. Based on the data obtained from 650 questionnaires in Henan Province and using the SOR model as the theoretical basis, this study explored the impact mechanism of the sur- vival situations of two types of farmers, namely, those with agricultural livelihoods (AL) and those with nonagricultural livelinoods (NL), on their willingness to convert farmland into non-grain land through the use of structural equation models. The results are as follows. The perceived benefits (PB) of NGC can improve their willingness to convert farmland to non-grain land, while the perceived risks (PR) of NGC reduce their willingness to convert farmland to non-grain land. The influence of PB and PR on farmer willingness to engage in NGC of cultivated land in the near term is greater than that in the long term. The influ- ence mechanism of perceived income and perceived risk on the willingness of non-grain conversions of cultivated land varies with the livelihood types of the farmers. The influ- ences of internal family situation (IS) and external family situations (ES) on the willingness to engage in NGC of cultivated land differ according to the types of farmer livelihood. There are differences in the influence mechanism of survival situations on different types of farmers’ willingness to non-grain conversion of cultivated land. Copyright: © 2025 Fan et al.

Food forms the foundation of national prosperity and is one of the key resources for the continuation of civilization. Food security is “the greatest concern of a nation” [1]. Govern- ments around the world have implemented food security as an important strategy. In recent years, China’s urbanization and industrialization have developed rapidly, and remarkable achievements have been made in economic construction. However, these achievements have Data availability statement: All the data related to this study have been included in the paper and its Supporting Information files. Funding: The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71904150, 41771438) and General Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Research in Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province (Grant number 2024-ZZJH-039). also brought great challenges to cultivated land protection and food security. The continuous spread of cities has threatened regional food security [2]. The rapid decrease in the scale of cultivated land in China has increased the risks to resources and food security [3]. From a strategic perspective, the Chinese government has the responsibility to ensure the country’s food security and to make food production self-sufficient [4]. The Chinese government has always attached great importance to food security. The Central Rural Work Conference held at the end of 2022 and the No. 1 Central Document of 2023 contain important instructions on food security and cultivated land protection. Currently, food security is facing many chal- lenges, especially the NGC of cultivated land. Research shows that the NGC rate of cultivated land in China is approximately 27%, among which the proportion of NGC of cultivated land in Southwest China is as high as 46% [5].\n",

However, most studies are imited to the spatial distribution of TVs or RTCVs themselves*”*!, studies on the correlation between the spatial distribution of ancient villages and tourism development elements*, and studies on rural tourism in typical TVs**-**. In addition, there are some similarities in the spatial distribution between historical villages and overty-stricken villages*®. Thus, research on the spatial structure and coupling of TV and RTCV can provide a clearer understanding of the economic situation in different rural areas, and a more precise rural development strategy will be implemented. The symbiotic spatial structure of the two can be applied to other developing countries and regions to provide an effective reference value for the sustainable development of rural tourism. The research area of this paper is Henan Province, which is the largest agricultural province and one of the rovinces with a large population in China’’. In terms of population size, geographical area and economic out- ut, it is comparable to medium-sized countries on the European continent, such as Sweden**”. In addition, Henan has complex and diverse topography and is rich in tourist resources and cultural diversity, with a similar spatial distribution of traditional villages and rural tourism destinations*”“'. This paper aims, first, to study the spatial distribution modes of TVs and RTCVs and to explore the relationships between the spatial distribution characteristics of villages and the multidimensional impact factors at the provincial level. Furthermore, their ernel density coupling relationship at the township level was revealed using spatial correlation. Finally, accord- ing to the analysis results, the spatial structure of rural tourism characteristic villages and traditional villages are discussed based on the theory of regional symbiosis. The research results can provide a reference for the sustainable development of traditional villages and rural tourism. Study area. Henan Province was named Yuzhou in ancient times and is known as ‘the hinterland of ancient China and the thoroughfare of ten provinces. It is one of the important cradles of the Chinese nation and an important comprehensive transportation hub and information flow logistics center in China. Henan Province is bounded between 31° 23’ N-36° 22’ N and 110° 21' E-116° 39’ E with a total area of 167,000 km? and is in the transition area of the second and third steps in central China (Fig. 1). It is surrounded by mountains on three sides with high terrain in the west and low terrain in the east. The northern border is the Taihang Mountain region, the western border is the Funiu Mountains region, and the southern border is the Ta-pieh Mountains. The farming culture and geographical characteristics have created a fully preserved ancient village culture and rural tourism resources. The Henan Provincial government announced 6 batches of 1019 provincial-level TVs and 4 batches of 471 provincial-level RTCVs by 2022. Data sources. To study the spatial correlation between the distribution of TVs and RTCVs in Henan Province, this paper took 1019 TVs (see Supplementary Table $1 online) and 471 RTCVs (see Supplementary Table S2 online) as the objects identified by the Henan People’s Government. They were abstracted as points by calibrating longitude and latitude via the Baidu API. QGIS 3.30, GeoDa 1.20, and other analytical tools were used to analyze the role of environmental factors and social factors. Relevant data sources include (1) the topo- graphic information of Henan Province DEM raster data with a resolution of 30 m and river data derived from the resource and environment data cloud platform of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/); (2) the administrative region (points) data were derived from the National Basic Geographic Information Center (http://www.ngcc.cn/); (3) the list of A-level scenic spots (see Supplementary Table $3 online) came from the Henan General Office of Culture and Tourism; and (4) data on population, per capita disposable income of all residents, road mileage and others were obtained from the national economic and social development statistical bulletin of relevant cities and prefectures in Henan Province in 2021 (the data, such as Henan Province 30 m DEM raster data, river system data, administrative region (points) data, population, per capita GDP data of county or city and road mileage. see Supplementary Data Collection D1 online).\n",

            "Content: In this study, we consider rural community resilience as a capacity which not only recognizes and anticipates the scope of damages, but also integrates multiple actors (public, private, nonprofit organizations) and coordi- nates their actions when facing natural disasters and other shocks. What’s more, besides those external support from the public organizations and governments, a key hypothesis underpinning the research of the paper is that local stakeholders’ cognition and their actions before, during and after disasters play an essential role in build- ing community resilience. In this sense, the paper aims to examine rural community resilience to disaster from the perspective of individuals’ cognition to disaster and their follow-up actions. The study area of this paper is Xun County which is located in Central China’s Henan Province. In July 2021, Xun County suffered extremely heavy rainstorm and flood disaster while 94% of its population were affected. This flood was unusual and can be used as a suitable research case to examine rural communities’ disaster response, post-disaster recovery as well as local residents’ cognition to disaster. The structure of the paper is as follows. After the introduction, the paper reviews related literatures and creates a theoretical framework by integrating people’s cognition, follow-up action and community resilience. The third section illustrates the study area, research methodology and data source. The fourth section displays and analyzes the research results. In the end, the paper closes by discussing research findings and conclusions. To date, scholars have used various methods to measure community resilience given the fact that there are no universally accepted measurement tools. Data limitation and diverging indicators of resilience are also challeng- ing the measurement of community resilience. Kapucu et al.?* conducted mail and online survey of emergency management professionals in eight Central Florida counties of the US to investigate the characteristics of disaster management in rural communities and ways to strengthen emergency management systems to develop and improve community disaster resilience. Boon’ carried out individual and group interviews of four disaster- impacted rural communities in Australia and examined significant generic factors to community resilience based on people’s views and attitudes. Hong et al.” used people’s mobility data (800,000 mobile devices) before, during and after the hurricane Harvey in the US in 2017 and measured inequality of community resilience which was considered as a function of the magnitude of impact and time to recovery. Suet al.*° depicted the evolution of rural community resilience in China’s Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and found changing stages of resilience given to the differences of governmental interventions and community self-organiza- tion abilities. What's more, there are also studies focusing on local stakeholders’ perceived community resilience which is measured by assessing individual’s perceptions of their community’s reactions to natural disasters””*!-**. Given the above descriptions about community resilience, we believe that it is the local villagers’ views, aware- ness and attitudes as well as their behaviors that form and support community disaster resilience. As Imperiale and Vanclay**° indicated, community resilience has both cognitive and interactional dimensions. Resilient communities are normally considered to be the places where residents tend to have better cognition and aware- ness of local vulnerabilities and stronger intention and bottom-up initiatives to change the situation'’. This is manifested by their decision making and actions when dealing with challenges and shocks. And this further explains why some rural communities are more resilient than others when disasters occur. Generally, individuals’ cognition towards disaster consists of four dimensions. The first dimension is their awareness and knowledge of potential disasters to local communities. This tightly relates to disaster preven- tion, preparedness and mitigation programs before disaster occurs. Sim et al.*° highlighted that comparing with material aid, the awareness of disaster prevention and public participation are the key variables which are significantly and positively correlated with community disaster resilience. The second cognition dimension is individual’s authority recognition under which the local villagers will follow orders and arrangements issued by the community committee during the disaster resistance and recovery periods. This helps to guarantee the unity of local residents’ action to mitigate disaster instead of staying in chaos. The importance and effective- ness of authority recognition were proved in Yang et al’s** study of measuring community disaster resilience in China’s Loess Plateau. Research findings showed that resilient communities are those where village committees and residents can work cooperatively and coherently. The third dimension of cognition is individuals’ aware- ness of self-participation and active involvement in resisting and mitigating disasters. This tightly connects to individuals’ sense of place and their local identity which are considered as the fourth dimension of cognition.\n",

            "Content: Quantitative analysis provides accurate numerical data for specific attributes of traditional villages, and we visualize these values in a three-dimensional coordinate system (Fig. 5). To analyze the trend of each quantitative indicator of traditional villages in both the east-west and north-south directions, it is useful to map the data scatter to the elevation, represented by the two coordinate axes of the bottom surface (longitude in the northwest- southeast direction and latitude in the northeast-southwest direction) along with the vertical axis. Subsequently, using the fitted surface resulting from this mapping process enables a more in-depth analysis of the overall trend exhibited by a specific indicator. The traditional villages in Henan Province exhibit a varied elevation profile, with a relatively high mean elevation and noticeable variability (Table 3). Although most villages are situated at lower elevations, a few outliers in locations such as the Taihang Mountains, Wangwu Mountains, and Funiu Mountains significantly raise the mean elevation (Fig. 5). Regarding proximity to rivers, most villages are located at relatively longer distances, with some outliers raising the mean and showing a broader distribution of distances instead of clustering together (Table 3). Additionally, most traditional villages are not situated in areas with dense river networks, a trend that is especially pronounced in the western part of Anyang City in northern Henan (Fig. 5). The trends in the Shape Index and Fractal Dimension show relatively high consistency, generally decreasing from northeast to southwest (Fig. 5). The positive skewness and higher kurtosis in the Shape Index indicate the presence of various irregular shapes, whereas the relatively consistent and lower values in the Fractal Dimension suggest less variability in geometric complexity. Furthermore, approximately 19.5% of the areas exhibit Shape Index values greater than 4, with nearly half concentrated in Xinyang City, indicating that the terrain in southern Henan has a more pronounced impact on the spatial patterns of traditional villages. The three indicators of the road network display similar patterns (Fig. 5), with Farness decreases from north to south, connection decreases from northeast to southwest, and Betweenness decreases from northwest to southeast. The standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of connection are low, indicating that most villages form well-connected clusters. In contrast, the skewness and kurtosis of Farness and between are high, with a few villages occupying significant positions as transportation hubs or interaction centers. These findings collectively provide a detailed description of the dynamic transportation network. The average Mixing Degree is 41.7%, falling below the 50% benchmark (Table 3). Only 14.6% of the villages have a Mixing Degree surpassing 70%, underscoring the pressure to intensify the protection of the original architectural forms This degree across the province decreases significantly from southeast to northwest, closely mirroring the spatial distribution of economic development (Fig. 5), reflecting the influence of farmers’ “traditional thinking” on the construction of new houses (modern style) and the protection of traditional village buildings. When comparing the consistency area, direction, and distance for architectural patterns, the area consistency is better, followed by angle and distance consistency (Table 3). Spatially, area consistency is lower in the center and higher around, whereas the angle and distance consistency are the opposite, being higher in the center and lower around (Fig. 5). According to the actual form, the central region of Henan exhibits relatively flat terrain, with larger and denser rural settlements, resulting in a pattern of \"small individual, large overall, and irregular arrangement\". Conversely, in the northern, western, and southern regions of Henan, characterized by rugged terrain, smaller village sizes, and lower population density, a pattern of \"large individual, small overall, and regular arrangement\" appears to form. The cross-scale study of macro, meso, and micro levels provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of traditional villages. From a macro perspective, village development is shaped by topography and river distances, which provide natural defense but limit expansion. At the meso level, the intricate traffic network reflects spatial hierarchies and diverse connections that influence village-wide movement. At the micro level, architectural preservation becomes crucial due to the influence of economic development and traditional mindsets. The cross-analysis process intricately weaves together geographical, cultural, and economic dimensions, offering a comprehensive depiction of the subtle forces at play in the evolution of traditional villages and providing a coherent narrative of the village's development.\n",

Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of ecological environment governance in Henan Province, it is necessary to (1) optimize the investment in environmental governance and improve environmental protection technology. In order to improve the comprehensive technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency, Some measures should be implemented, such as Introducing technology projects that can effectively improve environmental governance, constantly improving the scientific and technological level in the field of environmental governance, paying attention to the research and development of practical technologies and equipment for environmental governance, training relevant professional and technical personnel, and stimulating innovation vitality. (2) Establish and improve the supervision mechanism of environmental governance and enhance the intensity of supervision. The utilization degree of resource input and the efficiency of resource allocation are particularly important for improving the efficiency of environmental governance. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve the policy system and supervision mechanism of environmental governance, and clarify the supervision responsibility; It is necessary to further promote the openness and transparency of environmental governance to ensure the effective implementation of environmental governance supervision; Strengthen the training of supervision methods, strengthen the supervision of environmental protection funds and the operation of related facilities. This work was financially supported by General project of humanities and social science research in universities of Henan Province (2022-ZDJH-00237).\n",

            "Content: Abstract.Using the University of Notre Dame Global Climate Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) assessment model for reference, the assessment system and model of agricultural disaster resistance in Henan Province are constructed.The spatial characteristics of agricultural disaster resistance subsystem (vulnerability and preparedness) of 18 cities in Henan Province in 2018 were studied by using GIS technology from six perspctives such as sensitivity, exposure, emergency, management, capacity to analyze. The results show that the agricultural disaster resistance ability of Henan Province is in the middle to lower level, showing the spatial difference pattern of high in the west, low in the southeast and weak in the north and south; the difference of vulnerability index is small, and the difference of preparedness index is large; the difference in the degree of preparedness is the main reason for the obvious difference in the level of agricultural disaster resistance; the development of agricultural disaster resistance in different regions is not balanced, and the disaster resistance in Zhengzhou is the strongest, followed by Luoyang and Sanmenxia, Zhoukou and Zhumadian are less resilient. Agricultural disasters have profoundly affected the social stability and healthy economic development of China for a long time. The core of disaster prevention and mitigation is to enhance the ability to resist risks, and the key is to build the ability to resist disasters. In May 2019, the United Nations convened the sixth Global Platform for Disaster Reduction conference on the theme \"Resilient Dividends: Towards Sustainable and Inclusive Societies \", which set out the goal of building resilient societies that are sustainable and inclusive. destructive outcomes that enable the organizational system to repair disasters and adaptive processes that improve the ability to respond to threats through the reorganization, transformation and learning of social organizational systems[4]. Resilience has also begun to gradually transition to resilience, research findings show that the two have basically converged. With the development of research, the ability to resist disasters has gone on Growing into a comprehensive concept that emphasizes both the intrinsic qualities of an organization or system and the ability to respond to and recover from disasters. The Disaster Resilience study began with the concept of \"resilience \". The American ecologist Holling creatively introduced resilience into ecosystem stability research in the 1970s, and ecosystem resilience research was more widely used in ecological environment restoration[1]; subsequently Timmerman and so on introduced resilience into the field of social and environmental change, linking resilience to vulnerability for the first time, believing resilience to be the system's ability to withstand and recover from external shocks[2]; joint national International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) introduced the concept of resilience into the field of disaster science as a measure of the ability of a system or community to resist or reduce the loss of natural disasters[3]. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the above scholars' views, Cutter points out that resilience includes both On the research of disaster resistance evaluation, scholars at home and abroad mainly focus on the following two aspects: first, qualitative evaluation. Qualitative evaluation pays more attention to the importance of resilience, influencing factors and intrinsic characteristics, and determines the resilience of society, organization or system through certain factor conditions. The National Research Council of the United States, in its report Resilience: A National Imperative, for example, in 2012, identified a unified framework of qualitative indicators for measuring resilience, namely,vulnerable populations, key environmental infrastructure, social factors and built infrastructure[5]; Bruneau identified resilience concept of necessity, and put forward that the evaluation of resilience to disasters is composed of four interrelated dimensional spaces: technical, organizational, social and economic[6]; Second, quantitative evaluation. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Han Jiannan introduced the disaster resistance ability of integrated prevention and control system into the evaluation model from the inherent attributes of the traditional disaster body and the passive attributes of the disaster bearing body for quantitative research [7]. Shaw proposed the Climate Disaster Resilience Index , which uses weighted combined averages to calculate targets from five aspects: natural environment, physical factors, social, economic and infrastructure regional resilience index[8]. Therefore, this study draws lessons from the global climate adaptation index (ND-GAIN) model of Notre Dame University in the United States, constructs the evaluation index system of agricultural resilience in Henan Province, and analyzes the agricultural resilience strength, spatial zoning characteristics and main influencing factors of 18 cities in Henan Province in 2018 in combination with GIS technology, so as to provide a reference basis for improving the agricultural resilience of Henan Province and reducing the difference of agricultural resilience among regions.\n",

Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Change in Ecosystem Quality and Its Driving Mechanism in Henan Province, China, from 2010 to 2020. Sustainability 2022, 14, 11742. https://doi.org/10.3390/ su141811742 Abstract: Henan Province is an important ecological barrier in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. It is of great signiﬁcance to study its ecosystem quality and the driving mechanisms behind this in order to realize ecological conservation and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. In this study, from the perspective of physical elements, socioeconomic elements, and policy adjustments, multi-source data on land use, population density, forestry engineering, and other indicators were selected to construct an index system of the driving factors of ecosystem quality in Henan Province. The characteristics of spatio-temporal change and the formation mechanism of ecosystem quality in Henan Province from 2010 to 2020 were analyzed by comprehensively using the gravity center analysis method and a geo-detector tool. The results showed the following: (1) The ecosystem quality of Henan Province in 2020 has increased by 27.7% compared with that in 2010, and the center of gravity of ecosystem quality continued to move to the northwest of Henan Province. The quality of ecosystems in the hilly region of Western Henan, Tongbai, and Nanyang was better than that in the northern Loess Platform Hilly Area and the Yellow River Plain, and it presented a spatial pattern in which the quality of the south was higher than that of the north, while the east and west were equal; (2) From 2010 to 2020, the average GDP and population density in Henan Province were the most important factors affecting the quality of its ecosystem. The effect of land-use diversity on ecosystem quality in the hilly region of Henan Province was stronger than that in the central and eastern plains; and (3) The interactions among the driving factors were mainly nonlinear enhancement and double factor enhancement, in which the interaction between socio-economic elements and natural environmental elements was the dominant interaction mode and could enhance the impact on the quality of the regional ecological environment. The results of this study indicate that attention should be paid to generating targeted industrial economy layout and land use policies in different natural domains.

With the intensiﬁcation of global climate change, the problem of the ecological environ- ment has become an important challenge for the sustainable development of human society, and it has become the focus of academic and government departments [1,2]. Since the 1990s, with the rapid development of China’s national economy and the increasingly prominent ecological and environmental problems, China has implemented a series of ecological construction projects, including the construction of national key ecological function zones and projects such as returning grain-growing land to forestry and grasslands. However, the process of urbanization and industrialization in China is developing rapidly, and the imbalance between protecting the ecological environment and socioeconomic development is still serious. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to examine the temporal and spatial variations in ecosystem quality and their inﬂuencing mechanisms with regard to maintaining ecological security, promoting sustainable development, and increasing human well-being. At present, ecological environment problems represent a research hotspot. Some schol- ars concerned about the impact of economic activities on the social ecosystem, while others mainly focus on the analysis of regional ecological environmental change mechanisms. For example, Alexandrescu et al. [3] and Rîs,teiu et al. [4] studied the impact of mining pollution in Romania on depopulation and social risk. Haq et al. [5] and Cretan et al. [6] analyzed the driving mechanism of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the regional ecosystem and urban development. Meanwhile, several studies focus on the impact of global climate change on the survival rights of the urban poor in countries such as Hungary, the Philippines, and Nigeria [7–9]. In these studies, a quantitative analysis of regional ecological environment changes was carried out to evaluate a certain ecological index in the region, which can be constructed via statistical methods and operational research [10–13]. Generally, the index is constructed by the analytic hierarchy process [14–16] and principal component analysis [17,18]. For example, Zhong et al. selected topography, temperature, GDP, and other indicators to establish an evaluation index system and evaluated the spatio-temporal variations in the ecological environment’s quality in Yunnan Province based on principal component analysis [17]. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) or the entropy weight method to develop an important environmental index (EI) to evaluate the regional ecological environment. Since vegetation plays an active role in the Earth’s environmental system [19–21], the ecological index can also be realized via remote sensing or GIS methods. For example, some studies have pro- posed remote sensing and the use of net primary productivity (NPP) [22], the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [23], the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [24] and the re-mote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) [25] to measure the variations in regional ecosystems. Yang et al. constructed the RSEI through principal component analysis to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution trends of the eco-environmental quality in the Yellow River Basin in China [26]. Quantitative evaluation of ecological indicators can be based on models summarized from different perspectives [27–30]. Taking quantitative analy- sis of ecosystem service functions as an example, the InVEST and RUSLE models have been widely used to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystem services or habitat According to related studies, the methods used to determine the driving mechanisms of ecological environment changes can be classiﬁed into two categories: non-spatial regres- sion models and spatial regression models. The non-spatial regression category includes the stepwise regression model [35], scenario analysis [36], constrained ordination tech- nique [37], curve estimate method [38],and ordinary least squares (OLS) [39]. The spatial regression category mainly includes the geo-detector method (GD) [40], geographically weighted regression (GWR) [41], and spatial lag model [42]. Compared with non-spatial regression models, spatial regression models consider the spatial heterogeneity of the driving factors by constructing local regression equations for each region [43,44], which is impossible in non-spatial regression models. Therefore, spatial regression models are widely used in ecological environment research. For example, Zhang et al. selected evalua- tion indicators such as soil, topography, and night light data in the arid region of northwest China and used the geo-detector model to analyze ecological vulnerability [45].\n",

Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16144. https://doi.org/10.3390/ ijerph192316144 Abstract: Exploring the assessment methods and multi-scale spatiotemporal interaction characteris- tics of ecosystem health is of great signiﬁcance for current ecosystem health theory and application research. Based on the regional differentiation theory and ecosystem service ﬂow theory, the spatial weight coefﬁcient and the modiﬁed coefﬁcient of spatial proximity effect were introduced to improve the regional ecosystem health assessment model. Then, the improved VORS model was used to evaluate the ecosystem health level in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River (MRYR) in China at multiple scales, and the ESTDA method was used to reveal the multi-scale spatiotemporal interaction characteristics of ecosystem health. The results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2018, the ecosystem health level at grid and county scale in the MRYR showed a trend of ﬁrst decline and then increase, and experienced a slow decline and a steady rise from 1990 to 2005 and 2005 to 2018, respectively. The ecosystem health level at the grid and county scale presented a spatially hierarchical structure with alternating low-value and high-value zones. (2) Compared with the county scale, the grid scale can describe the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem health more reﬁned, indicating the existence of spatial scale effects in ecosystem health assessment. (3) The rapid urbanization areas, the ecologically fragile areas in the central and western regions and the transitional zone between mountain and basin have more dynamic spatial structure, and stronger spatio-temporal interaction process. (4) In terms of LISA spatio-temporal transition, the regional system as a whole had strong path-dependent and lock-in characteristics, and the local spatial correlation structure of ecosystem health gradually tended to be stable during the study period. (5) In terms of spatio-temporal inter- action network, there were strong spatio-temporal competition in the process of time evolution in six typical regions, such as the surrounding cities of provincial capitals, the fringe areas of cities, the transitional zone between mountain and basin, the transitional zone of ecologically fragile regions, Copyright: © 2022 by the authors.

With the intensiﬁcation of human activities, the problem of ecosystem health has become the main environmental problem faced by human beings [1–3]. The deterioration of ecosystem health will directly affect the service function of ecosystem and human access to and use of natural resources, and then pose a grievous menace to human health and the sustainable development of economic society [4–6]. Under the dual inﬂuence of climate and human activities, the ecologically fragile areas in Western China have produced soil erosion [7], water and soil environmental pollution [8–10], over exploitation of water resources [6,11,12], land desertiﬁcation [13,14], vegetation degradation [15–17] and a series of eco-environmental problems, and seriously endanger the healthy development of regional ecosystem. In the context of promoting the eco-environmental protection and high- quality development strategy in the Yellow River Basin, this study scientiﬁcally assessed the ecosystem health level in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River, and explored the multi- scale spatial pattern and spatio-temporal interaction characteristics of ecosystem health, which has important theoretical and practical signiﬁcance for environmental management and regional sustainable development. Ecosystem health refers to the sustainability and self-maintenance ability of ecosystem chimeras and the stability of ecosystem services provided at a certain spatial and temporal scale [18–20]. The exploration of ecosystem health assessment methods began in the late 1980s. According to the proposed chronological order, the comprehensive indicator method mainly includes the vigor-organization-resilience (VOR) model [18,20], subsystem model, pressure-state-response (PSR) model [21], and the vigor-organization-resilience-ecosystem services (VORS) model [2,19,22,23]. Among them, the VORS model has been the most widely used because it can fully reﬂect the inherent and complex characteristics of a regional ecosystem under the framework of human-earth system coupling, as well as the interaction between a natural ecosystem and the human socio-economic system [18,19,24]. However, it still has the following problems: ﬁrst, in terms of setting the weight of resistance and resilience in the calculation formula of ecosystem resilience, previous studies have judged the overall economic development level and human activity intensity of the study area based on personal experience, and then assigned the weight of resistance and resilience, respectively [18,19,22]. However, in large-scale region studies, the economic development level and human activity intensity of different units within the study area have spatial heterogeneity, so the weights of resilience and resistance of different research units need to be assigned separately. Second, a few scholars have been begun to keep a watchful eye on spatial proximity effect for the past few years [19,22], but there are still two limitations. On the one hand, most studies only represent the service value of each ecosystem in the research unit through the service value coefﬁcient of each ecosystem, without considering the difference of the total value of ecosystem services in each research unit. On the other hand, when calculating the spatial proximity effect coefﬁcient, the existing research only considers the inﬂuence of the adjacent pixel on the four sides around the center pixel. However, the center pixel is not only affected by the four pixels adjacent to the edge, but also by the four pixels adjacent to the point. Therefore, the inﬂuence of eight adjacent pixels should be considered when calculating the spatial proximity effect coefﬁcient. Based on this, the VORS model was improved by modifying the ecosystem elasticity formula and Since the 1990s, the importance of space for socioeconomic theory has been widely recognized, and a large number of theoretical and empirical studies have shown that spatial effects (spatial dependence and heterogeneity) have become common, rather than an excep- tion in empirical studies [25]. Spatio-temporal interaction has become an important method and perspective for geographers to study environmental problems and socioeconomic sus- tainable development. At present, many scholars have discussed the effective integration of time factor into exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). The exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis (ESTDA) framework proposed by Rey implements the coupling and visual display of spatio-temporal association by introducing graph theory, which is a more beneﬁ- cial exploration of spatio-temporal interaction analysis [25–27]. In recent years, with the implementation of ecological conservation strategies in the Yellow River Basin of China, and the increasing inter-regional ecosystem linkages and spatial spillover effects, it is possi- ble that the ecosystem health levels among neighboring regions will appear agglomeration and similar dynamic patterns over time. In addition, based on the theories of ecosystem service ﬂows and environmental externalities, the spatio-temporal behavior of ecosystem services and its eco-environmental effects ﬂows within a region highlights the importance of spatio-temporal interactions in analyzing the dynamics of regional eco...\n",

            "Content: Considering the limitations of VORS model, this study introduced the spatial weight coefﬁcient and the modiﬁed spatial proximity effect coefﬁcient to improve the VORS model. The formula of the improved VORS model is expressed as Formulas (1) and (2): In the above formulas, EHI represents the ecosystem health level, PHI is the ecosystem ontology health level. EV is ecosystem vigor, EO is ecosystem organization, ER is ecosystem resilience, and ES represents ecosystem service value. (1) Ecosystem vigor (EV). EV depicts the metabolic or primary proliﬁcacy of regional ecosystem [2,19]. The NDVI is compactly made relevant to vegetation growth and net pri- mary proliﬁcacy, and has been broadly shown to be a valid index for evaluating ecosystem vigor level [2,19,22,34]. Hence, this study chose NDVI to represent the ecosystem vigor level. (2) Ecosystem organization (EO). EO refers to the diversity of composite ecosystem elements composition and processes, i.e., the completeness and complicacy of regional ecosystem structure and functionality [29,34,35]. Ecosystem organization can be charac- terized by landscape heterogeneity (LH), holistic landscape connectivity (LC), and con- nectivity of important ecosystems (CIE) [2,22]. Among them, landscape heterogeneity is currently characterized by Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI) and area-weighted patch fractal dimension (AWMPFD). The landscape division index (DIVISION) and landscape contagion index (CONTAG) are usually used to characterize the holistic landscape con- nectivity [19,22,31]. The patch fragmentation index (PFN) and patch connectivity index (CON) of woodlands, grasslands, and watersheds are used to represent the important ecosystems connectivity [22]. The weights of LH, LC and CIE are assigned as 0.35, 0.35 and 0.3, severally, according to their relative importance [19,22,31,35,36]. The formula of ecosystem organization is expressed as Formula (3): = (0.1 x AWMPED + 0.25 x SHDI) + (0.2 x DIVISION + 0.15 x CONTAG)+ (3) 0.07 x PF Ny + 0.03 x CONy + 0.07 x PFNw + 0.03 x CONw + 0.07 x PFN, + 0.03 x CON, f f & 8 In Formula (3), PFNf, PFNg, and PFNw are the patch fragmentation indices of wood- land, grassland, and water, respectively. CONf,CONg, and CONw are the patch connectiv- ity indices of forest, grassland, and water, respectively. To eliminate the possible differences in dimensions and magnitudes between indicators, we divide all indicators into positive indicators and reverse indicators before calculating organizational power, and then use the extreme value standardization method to standardize the data. (3) Ecosystem resilience (ER). ER delegates to the capacity of a regional ecosystem to overcome internal and external pressures (resistance) during the stress process and the ability to restore its own structure and functionality (resilience) after the stress disap- pears [19,22,29]. Referring to the mature practice of pre-existing study [31], we use the resistance and resilience coefﬁcient to measure the resistance value and resilience value (Table 2). Existing studies have judged the overall economic development level and human activity intensity of the study area based on personal experience, and then assigned the weights of resistance and resilience accordingly [19,22]. However, the level of economic development and the intension of human activity in different units within the study area are spatially heterogeneous, so it is necessary to spatially assign the weights of resilience and resistance to different study units. In view of this, this paper draws on the idea of piecewise function and introduces spatial weight coefﬁcients to spatially correct the ecosys- tem elasticity formula. Among them, the subsection interval of the weight coefﬁcient refers to the existing research results [2,22,31,34–36], and the ratio of the per capita GDP of the research unit to the per capita GDP of the research area is used as the division basis [37–39]. The revised formula of ecosystem resilience is expressed as Formulas (4)–(6): In Formulas (4)–(6), ERi is the ecosystem resilience. Pm is the ratio of the area of each landscape type to the total area of the study unit. wi t is the ecosystem resilience weight, 1 − wi t is the ecosystem resistance weight. Resistm is the resistance coefﬁcient, Resilm is the resilience coefﬁcient (Table 2). PerGDPi is the per capita GDP, PerGDP is the average of per capita GDP of all research units in the same period, GDPi is the total GDP, POPi is the total population. (4) Ecosystem services (ES). ES delegates to the life-sustaining products and services acquired immediately or mediately through the structure, process, and functionality of the ecosystem. It is compactly connected with human health and well-being [40–42]. The continuous feed power of ecosystem service functions and the analysis of the cost- beneﬁt of ecosystem services are the key criteria to achieving the overall and macroscopic assessment of ecosystem health under the framework of human-land coupling, reﬂecting the interaction between natural ecosystems and human socioeconomic systems [18,19]. From the perspective of ecosystem service ﬂow, ecosystem services can be delivered to spatially adjacent regions [18,43]. Therefore, we should consider the spatial proximity interaction effect when calculating ecosystem services, and further revise the assessment results of ecosystem services. Calculation steps of ecosystem service value based on spatial proximity interaction effect: (1) Compute the amount of ecosystem service value of the standard equivalent factor of each research unit (Formula (7)). (2) According to the three temporal and spatial dynamic factors of net primary productivity of vegetation (NPP), precipitation and soil retention, correct the basic equivalent table of ecosystem service value (Table S1), and then use the equivalent factor method to compute the total value of ecosystem services in each year and each research unit (Formula (8)). (3) Compute the spatial proximity total effect coefﬁcient of each study unit (Formula (9)). (4) Calculation of the ecosystem service value based on the spatial proximity effect (Formula (9)). The revised formula of ecosystem service is expressed as Formulas (7)–(9): In Formulas (7)–(9), Di is the ecosystem service value of the standard equivalent factor of the ith research unit. Ski is the yield (kg) of the ith research unit and the kth food crop (three food crops, rice, wheat, and corn are selected). Vki is the unit food crop of the kth food crop economic value (yuan/kg). Ai are the total sown area (ha) of food crops. n1 represents the service functions of food production, raw material production, gas regulation, climate regulation, environmental puriﬁcation, maintenance of nutrient cycle, biodiversity, and aesthetic landscape, n2 represents the service function of water resources supply and hydrological regulation, and n3 represents the service function of soil conservation. Nij is the spatiotemporal dynamic correction factor of NPP, Rij is the temporal and spatial dynamic correction factor of precipitation, Sij is the temporal and spatial dynamic correction factor of soil conservation. Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was adopted to compute the soil retention [44]. ESVij is the total value of ecosystem services, LAa ij is the area of land type a. ESVij(SNE) is the ecosystem service value based on the spatial proximity effect, CSNEij is the total effect coefﬁcient of spatial proximity. Sc k is the spatial proximity effect coefﬁcient of ecosystem services corresponding to the c-th pixel around the central pixel k (Table 3). m is the number of pixels included in research unit i. It should be noted that referring to the previous study results [18,19,22], we combined desert and bare land into unused land for uniﬁed calculation in the process of calculating the total effect coefﬁcient of spatial proximity.\n",
