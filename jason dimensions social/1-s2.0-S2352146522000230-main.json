With the development of economy and society, the impact of human activities on the environment is deepening and serious, in fact, economic and social development. The concept of sustainable development further emphasizes the coordinated development of the the further acceleration of urbanization, the environmental pollution problem has become an important influencing factor of human environment, economy and society. Among the environmental pollution problems, air pollution problem is an important part of economic and social development. The concept of sustainable development further emphasizes the coordinated development of the environmental pollution. An effective solution to the air pollution problem has an important contribution to the environmental pollution environment, economy and society. Among the environmental pollution problems, air pollution problem is an important part of problem and an important contribution to sustainable development. environmental pollution. An effective solution to the air pollution problem has an important contribution to the environmental pollution The air pollution problem is mainly related to the emission of pollutant gases from human urban activities. The main air pollutant problem and an important contribution to sustainable development. The air pollution problem is mainly related to the emission of pollutant gases from human urban activities. The main air pollutant main source of urban air pollutants and have the highest proportion of impact on urban air pollution. According to the data from China's emission pathways include factory exhaust, automobile exhaust, and urban heating. According to studies, automobile emissions are the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, traditional fuel motor vehicles have become an important source of air pollution in China, and main source of urban air pollutants and have the highest proportion of impact on urban air pollution. According to the data from China's exhaust emissions from fuel motor vehicles are an important cause of ambient air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions from Ministry of Ecology and Environment, traditional fuel motor vehicles have become an important source of air pollution in China, and traditional fuel vehicles account for more than a quarter of national greenhouse gas emissions. Although China's electricity production exhaust emissions from fuel motor vehicles are an important cause of ambient air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions from is mainly generated by coal, studies have shown that the environmental pollution from concentrated coal production is still less than traditional fuel vehicles account for more than a quarter of national greenhouse gas emissions. Although China's electricity production is mainly generated by coal, studies have shown that the environmental pollution from concentrated coal production is still less than This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0) Peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of the Transport Infrastructure: Territory Development and Sustainability 10.1016/j.trpro.2022.01.016 that from fuel vehicles, so electric vehicles are still cleaner in terms of emissions compared to fuel vehicles. In addition, with the transformation of China's power structure, the proportion of coal power generation will be further reduced, and the environmental cleanliness of electric vehicles will be further increased compared to fuel vehicles. Therefore, for the management of motor vehicles: the gradual shift from fuel cars to electric cars is very conducive to energy saving and emission reduction, and is an important way to effectively solve air pollution.",
    "Electric vehicles can be divided into pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles according to the current technical conditions. Plug-in hybrid is abbreviated as PHEV, plug-in hybrid power source is electric energy and fuel, plug-in hybrid has a relatively large battery, which can be charged externally and driven in pure electric mode, and then driven in hybrid mode (mainly with internal combustion engine) after the battery is depleted, and the battery is charged at the right time. Pure electric vehicles, referred to as BEVs, are powered entirely by the on-board battery and drive the wheels with an electric motor, without an internal combustion engine and without refueling (Björnsson and Karlsson, 2017). Although the battery technology of electric vehicles has been improved, there is still a big gap in mileage compared with fuel cars, and the existing charging infrastructure is still imperfect. These are the reasons for the lack of overall awareness and trust in EVs. In order to solve the impact of these problems on the consumption of electric vehicles, government subsidies have become the most effective and important means. Government subsidies play an important role in both the supply and demand sides of the EV industry market. Subsidies on the industry side can improve the supply-side production capacity and meet consumer demand; subsidies on the consumer demand side can increase consumers' willingness to purchase EVs and increase actual consumer demand. The focus of this study is on the impact of government subsidies on the consumer side on consumers' willingness to purchase EVs, how much subsidy is acceptable to consumers, and what is the difference in consumers' willingness to accept different types of EVs, which are the focus Compared with the early start of EV development in developed countries, China's EV technology development started in 2000, with a late start and weak technology accumulation (Xiaofeng and Zhimin, 2016). However, in 2001, China formulated a major special plan for EVs, which has guiding policy support for EV development and has promoted technical progress in battery performance, maintenance and cost control. In 2010, China has achieved the \"Electric Vehicle Industrial Development Plan\". In 2010, the industrialization of electric vehicles has made great progress, with hybrid electric vehicles being the main culmination of the industrialization (Baojun and Jiangpeng, 2015). By 2019, the industrialization of fuel cell EVs has also made further development, and China's EV market share has further increased to become the second largest EV market after the European EV market (Wu et al., 2021). Electric vehicle industry incentive policy has important significance for the development of electric vehicle industry. The development of electric vehicles cannot be separated from the development of technology, and the progress of electric vehicle technology cannot be separated from the policy and financial support. The development of the electric vehicle market also represents the degree of industrial development, so the development of the electric vehicle market is also inseparable from the policy support. For the development of electric vehicle industry, all countries have corresponding incentive policies, which are mainly divided into monetary incentive policies based on funds and non-monetary incentive policies based on privileges. Examples of relevant monetary incentives are: European countries take tax credits for the EV industry, industry chain financial support; China takes subsidies for EVs and government procurement. Related non-monetary incentives are: EV technology application privileges, EV industry registration layout privileges (Song et al., 2020). EV consumption is the last link in the development of EV industry, and EV consumption plays a crucial role in the development of EV industry. EV consumption incentive policy is also an important part of EV incentive policy of each country. EV incentive policies make consumers choose to buy EVs through government guidance and intervention. China's EV consumption has shown a continuous growth trend in recent years, with sales reaching 480,000 units in 2017, surpassing 1.25 million units in 2018, and remaining at 1.2 million units in 2019. This growth cannot be achieved without China's EV consumption incentive policies. China's EV consumption stimulation policies are divided into four main categories: 1) purchase incentives, which mainly refers to the government's financial subsidies when consumers purchase EVs; 2) licensing incentives, which refers to the provision of exclusive license plates for consumers and facilitation in vehicle licensing; 3) vehicle incentives, which refers to preferential facilities such as dedicated parking and green lanes for EVs; and 4) charging incentives, which refers to (4) charging incentive policy, which refers to the preferential charging cost policy of electric vehicles. Consumer incentives can be divided into national and regional consumer incentives according to the region and scope of impact. The national subsidy policy is aimed at the purchase of pure electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, and the amount of the national subsidy policy decreases over time. In its place, each province and municipality has developed a regional subsidy policy for the purchase of EVs. The local subsidies for EVs are diversified and the amount and items of subsidies are determined by the policies of each province and city. The subsidies include insurance subsidies, electric vehicle charging subsidies, license plate subsidies, etc. The amount of subsidies also ranges from 5,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. Since local subsidies are becoming the main form of subsidies, it is important for different localities to formulate targeted subsidies according to consumers' willingness to purchase EVs, to understand the main factors affecting consumers' purchase of EVs, and to provide a reasonable amount of subsidies for the main factors. The significance of this study is to use the contingent valuation method to investigate consumers' willingness to receive subsidies, and to obtain the main factors affecting consumers' willingness to purchase EVs and the amount of subsidies they can accept, so as to provide guiding suggestions for the government to The rest of the paper contains five parts, the second part is a literature review of relevant methods, the third part is a summarize of the questionnaire data, the fourth part represents the results of the econometric model, the fifth part is a further discussion of the results, and the last part is the conclusions and recommendations of the paper.",
    "There are two main methods for applying SPM in the field of electric vehicles: the conditional valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). the contingent valuation method is used in the field of electric vehicle research mainly by asking respondents about their willingness to pay (WTP) by means of a questionnaire (Hidrue et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2019; Noel et al., 2019). The most studied method for the purchase intention of electric vehicles is the structural equation method (Huang and Ge, 2019; Mohamed et al., 2016; Will & Schuller, 2016). The willingness to pay approach has also been used to study consumers' willingness to pay for EVs (Bansal et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2019; Ramos-Real et al., 2018). However, there is a gap in the existing research on Chinese consumers' willingness to accept subsidies for the purchase of EVs, so this study provides a useful reference for policy making by estimating the willingness to accept subsidies. This study also analyzes the difference between the willingness to pay for BEVs and PHEVs from two aspects, which not only provides effective information for policy making, but also provides direction for the further development of the EV market through the willingness to pay for both types of EVs. This paper is based on the CVM method in designing the survey questionnaire. In contrast to previous studies, the willingness to accept rather than willingness to pay was used in the survey. For CVM studies, the most commonly used econometric model is the logit model. The logit model can be represented as: represents the independent variables, and represents estimated parameters of the independent variables; is the error term. According to the CVM method, the questionnaire was designed in two parts. The first part of the questionnaire focused on the basic 𝑧𝑧� 𝑢𝑢� 𝛽𝛽 background information of the respondents, including their gender, age, income status and educational background. The second part of the questionnaire is about the respondents' perceptions of EVs, including the environmental impact of EVs, EV driving range, charging practices, safety, charging post facilities and maintenance. The survey questionnaire was collected from June 2019 to September 2019 in Nanyang City, Henan Province, China. The target population was selected to be the consumers going to buy a new vehicle. 150 consumers were randomly selected as the target population, the valid questionnaires are 138. Table 1 is a statistical description of the questionnaire. Table 1 shows the statistical description of the questionnaire. It can be seen that the proportion of respondents who are male reaches 63%, the average age of respondents is 38 years old, the average monthly income of respondents reaches 5755 RMB, and the majority of respondents have an educational background above high school. Table 2 shows the results of the descriptive statistics of the willingness to accept section of the questionnaire. The number of respondents who can accept the subsidy amount for PHEV is 54, accounting for 39% in the PHEV survey; the number of respondents who can accept the subsidy amount for BEV is 48, accounting for 34% in the BEV survey. A logit econometric model was constructed based on Equation 2. The results of the econometric analysis of WTA for both BEV and PHEV types of electric vehicles are presented in Table 3. The results in Table 3 show that gender and income have a significant effect on the final willingness to accept of the BEV subsidy measure at 95% significance. Women and higher income earners are more likely to accept the BEV subsidy. Educational background affects the final intention to accept at 99% significance level, the higher the education level the more likely to consider accepting of the BEV subsidy. Age influences the final willingness to accept at 90% significance level, the younger the age the more likely to accept the BEV subsidy. In addition to the respondents' own background conditions, the three variables of BEV's contribution to the environment, charging facilities and charging time also influence the final willingness to accept at 99% significance level. the driving range and maintenance of BEVs influence the final willingness to accept at 95% significance level. the safety of BEVs does not have a significant influence on the final willingness to accept the subsidy among the respondents. The results for the PHEV measures are significantly different from BEV in terms of respondent background variables, with only educational background having an effect on the eventual willingness to accept of the PHEV subsidy at the 90% significance level. Gender, age, and income do not have a significant effect on the final willingness to accept of PHEV subsidies. In the survey related to the awareness of PHEVs, the perception that PHEVs have an impact on the environment affects the final acceptance intention at 99% significance level, safety and charging facilities affect the acceptance intention at 95% significance level, and charging time affects the acceptance intention at 90% significance level.",
    "Table 4 shows the respondents’ mean willingness to accept of BEV and PHEV subsidies. The mean willingness to accept for BEV is 26.505 RMB and for PHEV is 24.867 RMB. The analysis of Table 3, Table 4 allows for a discussion of two aspects. The first aspect is discussed in terms of the basic background of the respondents, and the second aspect can be discussed in terms of the respondents' awareness of electric vehicles. First of all, the basic background of the respondents shows that gender plays a significant role in the willingness to accept BEV subsidies, and women are more likely to accept BEV subsidies to purchase BEVs, which is similar to previous studies (Erdem et al., 2010). However, gender did not have a significant effect in the PHEV subsidy. Based on this result, it can be analyzed that BEVs in China are smaller in size, which is more in line with women's demand for car as a mobility tool, while men do not have a strong preference for smaller BEVs, which results in women being more likely to accept BEV subsidies to purchase BEVs, while men do not have the willingness to purchase them. The PHEVs are not very different from the regular fuel cars, so the gender effect is not obvious. The results of the logit model show that one important variable, educational background, is significantly influenced in the willingness to accept subsidies for both BEVs and PHEVs (Lane & Potter, 2007). Both BEVs and PHEVs have a higher environmental improvement effect than regular fuel cars, so owners with higher education backgrounds generally have higher environmental awareness and are more able to choose to buy electric vehicles from the perspective of environmental protection. This is consistent with the results of the survey on respondents' awareness of electric vehicles. Another variable worthy of attention is age, in the BEV logit model results show that the younger the age, the more likely to accept subsidies to buy BEVs, which is also related to the cognitive level of young people, who are more receptive to new things than older people, and are more willing to try new things, which is an important guideline for opening up the electric vehicle market. The second aspect from the respondents' perception of electric vehicles, again, has a lot to discuss. The first is that environmental awareness is one of the most significant variables in respondents' choice to accept EV subsidies; the more environmentally conscious respondents are, the more likely they are to accept subsidies to purchase EVs. The other two variables are related to EV charging, which also play an important role in the final acceptance of EVs, the first one is the charging infrastructure such as EV charging piles and charging stations, through the analysis of the data, we can get that the more respondents value the charging infrastructure, the less likely they are to choose EVs. The reason for this is that the charging infrastructure for EVs in China is still not perfect, especially in small cities, and the places that can provide convenient charging places or charging piles are very limited, which greatly restricts the use of EVs, so the more important the charging infrastructure is, the less likely they are to choose to buy EVs. The second one is related to the battery, the more the respondents value the charging time, the less they will choose to buy an EV, the current EV battery charging technology has made great progress, but the fast-charging technology still has a long way to go, so with the battery capacity limiting the driving range, the fast-charging technology is another important variable that affects the purchase of an EV. According to Table 3, we can see that the charging time for BEV is much higher than that for PHEV, because PHEV has fuel to provide alternative, while the charging time for BEV directly affects the sustainability of EV driving, so the current charging technology is also an important reason to influence consumers to buy EV. With the further deepening of the concept of sustainable development and the advancement of China's sustainable development process, the problem of air quality and environmental pollution urgently needs to be solved, of which promoting the popularity and development of electric vehicles is of great significance to solving environmental problems and even promoting sustainable development. In this paper, the development of electric vehicle industry, electric vehicle market and electric vehicle subsidy policy in China is reviewed through the collection of related literature. The CVM method is used to further understand consumers' willingness to accept government subsidies for purchasing EVs, and this method is used to build a bridge between the policy and consumers by means of questionnaire data collection. By calculating the mean WTA, it can be seen that consumers accept higher subsidy amounts for BEVs than for PHEVs, so the government needs to focus on this when formulating policies. The analysis of the econometric model also shows that environmental awareness plays an important role in influencing consumers' decision to purchase EVs. In order to better achieve the goal of environmental sustainability and further promote EVs, the government needs to raise the environmental awareness of citizens and promote the positive impact of EVs on the environment. It is also important to see that charging facilities and technology also have an important impact on the willingness to accept EVs, and to further invest funds into these areas.",
    "The contribution of this paper to the research related to the electric vehicle field is that firstly, it systematically composes the development history of electric vehicles in China from three aspects: industry to market to government policies. The second point is that this paper innovatively adopts the CVM to investigate the consumers' willingness to accept government subsidies for EVs. There are two advantages in choosing the willingness to accept as the research objective: firstly, it can understand the factors that influence consumers to purchase EVs, and secondly, it can provide data support for the government to formulate the subsidy policy. Willingness to accept is a good combination of consumer needs and government subsidies, which is the most important contribution of this paper compared with previous studies. 1.
