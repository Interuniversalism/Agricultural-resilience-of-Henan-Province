The main function of urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province is to organize and carry out activities. The life of sports associations is to carry out colorful brand events favored by members, and it is also the main reason to attract public attention and join them.By carrying out and creating influential and well-known events, we can not only meet the needs of social participation and appreciation, but also create good social and economic benefits.It is found that the number of sports associations at the provincial, municipal and county (district) levels to undertake events and carry out activities in Henan province is obviously unbalanced.Even for sports associations of different categories, scale and development time at the same level, there are obvious differences in the number of events and activities undertaken each year, most of them have dozens of events and activities each year, some activities have become the brand of the association, while some activities of the association are very poor in effectiveness, and only a few events and activities are carried out each year.In addition, as shown in Table 1, it can be seen from the survey results of the effectiveness of sports associations in Henan Province that the number of members who choose \"general\" is 735, accounting for 32.5%, ranking first.The number of members who chose \"relatively strong\" was 566, accounting for 25.1%, ranking second;The number of members who chose \"relatively poor\" was 492, accounting for 21.8%, ranking third;The number of members who chose \"very strong\" was 247, accounting for 10.9%, ranking fourth;The number of members who chose \"very poor\" was The 13th Five-Year Plan for the development of Sports in Henan Province describes the development goals of continuing to develop the construction of a strong province of sports, and takes the establishment and improvement of the public service system of sports as the focus of the development of mass sports.The construction of sports organization system is an important part of the construction of sports public service system in Henan Province, and the quantity, scale and activities of urban and rural sports associations in Henan province determine the 218, accounting for 9.7%, the last place in the list.It shows that the activity efficiency of urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province is not too high on the whole, the number of people who choose \"general\" is the largest, and the number of people who choose \"relatively strong\" and \"very strong\" is less than 40%, indicating that the effectiveness of the activities of urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province is not very good. In the process of the transformation of urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province, we should not only pay attention to improving the number of activities, but also pay attention to improving the number of activities.Special attention should also be paid to the effect of the activity.",
    "735 492 218 32.5 21.8 9.7 1 3 5 associations carry out fewer activities and lack of brand events. Even a few associations do not act in accordance with the prescribed regulations, have chaotic management, disorderly activities or even do not carry out activities all year round, which damages the basic sports interests of members.Member satisfaction is extremely low.In order to understand the satisfaction of members of sports associations in Henan Province, the research carried out a survey.As shown in Table 2, the number of members who chose \"not satisfied\" was 705, accounting for 31.2%, ranking the first.

Members' Satisfaction with Club Activities Social members have always been the main body of sports associations, and the active degree of social members in sports associations plays a decisive role in the development and direction of sports associations [4].Therefore, the activities of sports associations should be centered on winning the satisfaction of members and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all members.In the process of substantive development, it is also necessary to fully reflect the subjectivity of members, constantly strengthen the subject consciousness of members, and let members actively, actively and consciously invest in the fitness activities organized by _ the community.The urban and = rural sports associations in Henan Province are in the process of developing towards marketization, socialization and __ materialization. The characteristics of some sports associations as \"semi-government organizations\" have not been completely eliminated, and the functions of autonomy, service, mediation and public welfare of their activities have not been fully played.As a result, the efficiency of club activities is not high, members are not fully formed as the main body, and some activities are not carried out from the perspective of members, which will cause some members to reduce their satisfaction with activities.In addition, due to the unbalanced development of urban and _ rural sports associations in Henan Province, the imperfect tules and regulations of some sports associations The business activities of sports associations are sports activities carried out within the permissible scope, and the vitality of sports associations lies in the organization and development of their activities [5].In Henan Province, the function of urban and rural sports associations depends on the development of their activities, and the quantity, quality and social influence of the activities are important manifestations of the materialization degree of sports associations. sports associations. Under the leadership of the national, provincial and municipal governments at all levels, and under the management of sports administrative departments and civil affairs departments at all levels, Henan urban and rural sports associations are gradually transforming from dependency to autonomy, service and efficiency according to the requirements of relevant policies. To carry out different forms of business activities is the active development of Henan urban and rural sports associations to better play their own benefits. The concrete embodiment of undertaking sports social service function. Through the investigation, it is found that the main forms of sports association activities in Henan Province include: providing policy suggestions, holding competitions, fitness activities, public welfare or commercial performances, social investigation and publicity, communication and training.In order to have a comprehensive, objective and accurate understanding of the main forms of urban and tural sports associations in Henan Province, the in Table 3, among the 102 persons in charge of urban and rural sports associations surveyed, \"fitness and exercise activities\" were all selected as the first;There were 92 people who chose \"holding competition activities\", accounting for 90.2% of the surveyed people, ranking second;86 people chose \"public welfare or commercial performance\", accounting for 84.3% of the surveyed people, ranking third;78 people chose \"communication and training\", accounting for 76.5% of the surveyed people, ranking fourth;62 people chose \"social investigation and publicity\", accounting for 60.8% of the surveyed people, ranking fifth;41 people chose \"provide policy advice\", accounting for 40.2% of the respondents, ranking sixth;Eighteen people, or 17.6% of the respondents, chose \"other forms\", ranking last.The main forms of activities of the urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province are fitness activities, competitions, public welfare or commercial performances, that is, the organization and development of physical exercise, competition and performance are the main forms of activities of the urban and rural sports associations in Henan Province.The second is to carry out sports and fitness exchanges and fitness skills training, carry out social surveys and fitness publicity, and provide relevant departments with policy suggestions on sports and fitness, and help local government departments do a good job in mass sports.
