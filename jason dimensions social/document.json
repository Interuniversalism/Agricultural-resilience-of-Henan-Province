However, this rapid growth has also uncovered challenges, such as a relatively uniform development model, an underwhelming destination image, outdated marketing strategies, limited tourism information accessibility, and environmental degradation. This study aims to comprehensively understand these issues and propose effective policies to enhance rural tourism development in Zhumadian. City. Methodology: Adopting a Research and Development approach, this study integrates qualitative and quantitative methods. Initially, a literature review was conducted to establish a theoretical foundation by analyzing rural tourism development models and sustainable development theories. There are 10 rural government cadres in Zhumadian, 20 Tourism bureau-related staff, and 5000 tourists. This was followed by a questionnaire survey to gather data on tourists’ participation, needs, and preferences in Zhumadian’s rural tourism. Furthermore, interviews with 10 government officials, 20 tourism bureau-related staff, and 357 tourists were conducted to explore their insights on designing and implementing rural tourism models. Based on these discussions, a policy guide tailored to Zhumadian’s context was formulated. Finally, an expert seminar evaluated the effectiveness of this model. Results: The findings reveal several key issues impeding the economic development of rural tourism in Zhumadian. These include a limited range of development models, inadequate destination branding, outdated promotional techniques, low information technology integration, and environmental concerns. Additionally, a SWOT analysis and tourist satisfaction surveys provided deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities facing rural tourism in the region. Conclusion: This paper offers a practical framework for enhancing rural tourism development in Zhumadian, grounded in the 4M theory and sustainable development principles. The proposed policy guide is expected to provide theoretical support for the city’s continued growth and sustainability within Henan Province. Moreover, it serves as a reference for similar rural tourism initiatives in other parts of China, highlighting the importance of integrated strategies that balance economic progress with environmental and cultural preservation. Rural tourism, a recent tourism trend, offers a respite from urban hustle and bustle, allowing tourists to immerse themselves in rural life and activities. This paper explores the significance of rural tourism in the global and Chinese contexts, emphasizing its contributions to economic growth, cultural preservation, and environmental sustainability. Drawing from the “14th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development” and other relevant studies, we delve into the challenges and successes of rural tourism, particularly in Zhumadian City, Henan Province. We discuss theoretical frameworks such as sustainable tourism and tourism policy to enrich our understanding. Furthermore, we identify specific issues like infrastructure, service quality, and environmental concerns in Zhumadian’s rural tourism and clarify the study’s objectives, aiming to formulate policy guidelines and propose sustainable practices. Balancing the benefits and challenges of rural tourism, this paper aims to present a comprehensive and critical perspective, concluding with the vast potential and promise of rural tourism in Zhumadian. Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 Rural tourism has emerged as a popular form of tourism, offering a unique experience away from the typical city or scenic spot vacations. It allows tourists to engage with rural life, culture, and activities, providing a refreshing break from urban routines. Globally, rural tourism has gained prominence due to its multifaceted contributions to economic development, cultural exchange, and environmental conservation. In China, specifically, the State Council’s “14th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development” underscores the importance of enhancing tourist experiences and facilitating “micro-vacations” and “micro-tourism.” This plan aligns with the broader goals of promoting people-centered urbanization and constructing beautiful rural areas, emphasizing efficient spatial allocation, optimized tourism functions, and strategic development of distinctive tourist villages and towns. Zhumadian, a city in Henan Province, stands out with its abundant rural resources and rich cultural heritage, making it an ideal destination for rural tourism. In recent years, the local government has recognized the potential of rural tourism as a key driver for economic development, outlining specific measures to support its growth (Council, 2022).",
    "it contributes significantly to economic growth, generating income for rural communities and creating employment opportunities. This, in turn, enhances the overall socio-economic status of these areas. Secondly, rural tourism serves as a vehicle for cultural preservation and exchange. It allows tourists to experience authentic rural cultures, traditions, and lifestyles, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for these values. Simultaneously, it provides an opportunity for rural communities to showcase their unique cultural heritage, promoting cultural diversity and inclusivity. Lastly, rural tourism, when managed sustainably, can contribute to environmental conservation. It encourages the protection of natural landscapes and ecosystems, promoting sustainable practices that benefit both local communities and the environment. While rural tourism in Zhumadian presents vast potential, it also faces several challenges. Infrastructure development in rural areas remains a crucial issue, requiring significant investment to improve accessibility, amenities, and service quality. Additionally, environmental concerns arise from the impact of tourism on local ecosystems, necessitating a careful balance between tourism development and environmental protection. However, Zhumadian’s rich natural landscapes, cultural heritages, and characteristic agriculture offer unique opportunities for rural tourism. The city’s diverse attractions, such as Chaya Mountain and Suya Lake, combined with its historical and cultural sites like the Nanhai Temple, create a compelling tourism offering. Furthermore, agricultural activities like grape and strawberry planting, along with farmhouse entertainment, provide immersive experiences for tourists. In conclusion, rural tourism in Zhumadian holds significant promise for economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental sustainability. By addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities, Zhumadian can emerge as a leading destination for rural tourism, offering enriching experiences for tourists and contributing to the overall growth and prosperity of the region. 3. To evaluate the feasibility of policy guidelines for rural tourism in Zhumadian, experts sought to discuss and modify them. Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 Policy Guidelines refer to a set of principles, rules, or instructions that guide the implementation of policies. In the context of rural tourism policies, China has recognized the significance of rural tourism in driving rural development. However, the implementation faces challenges, particularly in terms of inadequate policy support. Yang (2023) analyzed Fuzhou’s rural tourism, emphasizing the need for stronger policy coherence and addressing issues such as cultural resource development and publicity gaps. Zhang et al. (2023) focused on Beijing, highlighting the role of transportation in rural tourism and the importance of scenic spot radiation. Wei and Luo (2023) proposed tailored cultural development and talent introduction for Xinyang’s rural tourism. Li (2009) examined the mixed impacts of tourism policies on Yanqing, while Liu (2023) outlined sustainable development strategies for Yuxi, including infrastructure improvement and innovative product development. Yang (2023) also emphasized green development and brand cultivation in rural tourism. Rural Tourism refers to travel to rural areas where visitors engage in leisure, sightseeing, experiential activities, and cultural exchanges within a natural setting. The literature on Rural Tourism highlights several key strategies for its development and revitalization. Zhang (2012) explores the development model of rural tourism in China based on tourism system theory. Zhang (2023) emphasizes the role of unique features in driving rural tourism, suggesting scientific planning, diversified product development, strengthened infrastructure, professional management, entrepreneurial support, and brand enhancement as effective approaches. Mu, Li, et al. (2023) focus on Cheng Kou County, advocating for diversified tourism products, improved infrastructure, enhanced service quality, expanded promotional channels, and supply-demand alignment. Zhu and Shang (2021) explore rural smart tourism, outlining the architecture and functionality of an intelligent tourism system, including cloud data management and tourist behavior analysis, and demonstrating its effectiveness through experimental research. SWOT analysis is a strategic tool for evaluating internal and external environments by identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Gong and Li (2014) used SWOT to analyze Shandong’s homestay industry, proposing measures like improving infrastructure and talent cultivation for sustainable development. Mo (2016) applied it to Zhejiang’s homestay tourism, suggesting countermeasures at different levels. Fang (2018), Lin and Wu (2017), and Diao and Jiang (2018) employed SWOT in specific regions, focusing on enhancing quality and local characteristics. Huang (2021) utilized the TOWS Matrix for rural transport in Chongqing. Zou and Yan (2022) and Zhang (2023) also adopted SWOT, emphasizing quantitative analysis and systematic approaches for comprehensive strategy formulation.",
    "4M Theory, commonly used in the fields of quality management and production management, refers to four key elements in the production process: Man, Machine, Material, and Method. Qian (2022) applied the 4M Theory to assess safety risks by analyzing the Man, Machine, Material, and Method elements in physical education settings. Hu (2021) utilized the 4M Theory to focus on system safety management to create a comprehensive safety education framework. Li (2021) employed the 4M Theory to examine the factors influencing public participation through the 4M lens. Ren (2022) integrated the 4M Theory to identify and mitigate fire risks by analyzing human, management, equipment, and environmental elements. Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 This study aims to analyze the basic situation of rural tourism and develop policy guidelines that can promote the development of rural tourism in Zhumadian. This study adopts the R&D (Research and Development) method, integrating both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The qualitative approach mainly involves interviews, while the quantitative aspect relies on questionnaire surveys and data analysis. To gather comprehensive information on rural tourism and commercial development in Zhumadian's scenic areas, interviews were conducted with local government officials, business operators, and residents. The questionnaire survey conducted in this study primarily targeted rural tourism practitioners, residents, and tourists visiting Zhumadian for rural tourism. This approach aimed to collect accurate and reliable data for a thorough analysis and summary of rural tourism trends in the area. There are 10 rural government cadres in Zhumadian, 20 Tourism bureau-related staff, and 5000 tourists. According to Morgan (1970), 10 village cadres, 20 Tourism bureau-related staff, and 357 tourists were interviewed and surveyed. This research follows a Research and Development (R&D) process, which comprises four primary stages: Research (R1) – Development (D1) – Research (R2) – Development (D2). The R&D methodology employed in this study consists of four distinct phases: initial research (R1), development (D1), further research (R2), and final development (D2). Each phase is meticulously designed to ensure comprehensive exploration and validation of the research questions. Data collection in this research is bifurcated into quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative segment, primary data is gathered through questionnaire surveys. A questionnaire was constructed using Questionnaire Star, and a QR code was generated to facilitate data collection. Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 Qualitative data is sourced from interviews. Before data collection, consent is obtained from all interviewees. Post-interviews, audio recordings, and chat transcripts are meticulously documented, analyzed, and compiled to derive meaningful insights. This study predominantly employs the questionnaire survey method for data analysis. Upon recovering the collected data and discarding invalid questionnaires, the remaining valid responses are systematically sorted. Subsequently, basic statistical methods are applied to analyze the data, ensuring a robust and thorough examination of the research findings. Environmental Site: Zhumadian boasts a strategic location in a plain area, offering convenient transportation. As a major agricultural city, it is rich in farmland and fruit fields. (Questionnaires, interviews, documents) Infrastructure: The government has provided strong support for the construction of beautiful villages, leading to improvements in transportation, communication, and water and electricity facilities. (Interview) Environmental Site: There is over-utilization of resources, leading to clustering and failure to consider sustainable use and circular development. (Questionnaires, interviews) Infrastructure: Traffic security risks are prevalent, with inadequate coverage of lighting, mirrors, WIFI, and monitoring. The facilities are not sufficiently intelligent. (Questionnaires, interviews) Service: There is no unified standard for services, resulting in dishonest business practices and poor customer experience. Additionally, the population is aging.

(Questionnaires, interviews) Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 The rural tourism sector in Zhumadian is under-invested, with low barriers to entry. The operations management team faces few competitors.",
    "Limited investment channels hinder the financing of rural tourism development. The rural tourism transportation system is not convenient enough, with remote locations posing challenges to maintaining an operations management team. The loss of high-quality young and middle-aged talent, along with the presence of elderly, solidified villagers who fear disrupting traditional life and could hinder the operations of rural tourism teams. Abundant Natural Resources: Zhumadian boasts rich land and property resources, a climate suitable for all four seasons, diverse agricultural products, and ample water resources. Ecological Attractiveness: The region features a beautiful ecological environment with a variety of vegetation cover, enhancing its appeal as a rural tourism destination. Cultural Heritage: Zhumadian has a long history and profound cultural background, which can be leveraged to attract tourists interested in cultural experiences. Lack of Innovation: The current rural tourism offerings in Zhumadian are predominantly limited to conventional forms such as farm visits, fruit picking, fishing, leisure activities, and health care, lacking innovative and diversified experiences. Limited Cultural Proficiency: The lack of professional management teams and inadequate experience in developing cultural tourism experiences hinders the full potential of Zhumadian’s cultural resources. Innovation in Internet Technology: The application of innovative Internet technologies can enhance the management and development of rural tourism through methods such as staff interviews and questionnaires. Public Awareness and Consumption Trends: Increasing public awareness of rural tourism and consumption trends can be gauged through documents, questionnaires, and interviews, helping to align development strategies with market demand. Policy and Development Focus: Through documents and interviews, the focus areas of rural tourism development can be identified, guiding future initiatives. Economic Impact on Local Families: Surveys can reveal the economic benefits to local families, indicating the positive effects of rural tourism development. Government Support: Interviews and published papers highlight the government’s full support for rural tourism, which is crucial for sustained development. Inefficient Transportation: The remoteness of rural tourism locations and inadequate transportation infrastructure, as reflected in questionnaires, can deter potential tourists. Imperfect Feedback Mechanisms: The lack of a robust evaluation feedback mechanism, identified through interviews and documents, can impede continuous improvement and development. Policy 1: Government Support for Rural Tourism Infrastructure and Service Facilities It is recommended that the government provide low-interest loan support to residents and rural businesses specifically for the construction of rural tourism infrastructure and service facilities. This financial support could be allocated towards the construction of guesthouses, the renovation of scenic area facilities, and improving transportation convenience. These initiatives will collectively enhance the tourism reception capacity and service quality, thereby fostering a more attractive and efficient rural tourism ecosystem. Policy 2: Streamlined Loan Application Procedures and Incentive Mechanisms The government should establish clear and efficient loan application procedures and streamline the approval process. Detailed guidelines for fund usage should be provided, and Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 dedicated loan service institutions should be established to offer consultation and support to applicants. Additionally, implementing loan repayment subsidies and incentive mechanisms will encourage the initiation and completion of more rural tourism projects, thereby boosting the overall development of the sector. Tax incentives should be provided to residents and businesses involved in rural tourism development. This could include reducing or exempting business tax, value-added tax, and relevant local taxes. Such measures will alleviate the financial burden on investors, encouraging them to allocate more resources to the construction and operation of rural tourism projects, ultimately fostering sustainable growth in the industry. The government should provide incentive support to businesses that conduct training in rural areas. This could include offering financial subsidies, tax incentives, or rewards to businesses that provide professional training services for residents and enterprises. This support will help rural practitioners acquire advanced skills and knowledge, enhancing their capabilities and improving the quality of rural tourism services. It is recommended that the government utilize official Douyin and Weibo accounts to systematically promote Zhumadian rural tourism. Content such as attraction introductions, tourism activities, and visitor experiences should be published to showcase the charm of rural areas through short videos and visual posts. Regularly hosting online interactive activities like lotteries and live broadcasts will boost public engagement and attract more visitors to rural tourism destinations.",
    "Policy 6: Protection and Promotion of Local Cultural Heritage and Natural Resources A series of projects should be implemented to protect and promote local cultural heritage and natural resources. The government should support and fund initiatives that enhance cultural experiences, such as traditional craft restoration, historical site preservation, and cultural event organization. Ensuring that rural tourism authentically showcases and preserves local culture is crucial. Additionally, natural landscapes and ecosystems should be protected to prevent negative environmental impacts from overdevelopment. Policy 7: Information Sharing, Resource Integration, and Public-Private Partnerships The government should organize regular forums and workshops to facilitate information sharing and resource integration, addressing collaboration issues effectively. Additionally, support should be provided for the establishment of public-private partnership projects to jointly develop tourism facilities and services. Enhancing the attractiveness of tourism through such collaborative efforts will contribute to the overall development and sustainability of rural tourism. Following extensive deliberation, the researchers conducted a comprehensive review and summarization of the meeting’s content. The outcomes of the discussion have been systematically organized and are presented in Table 1. Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 It is recommended that the government systematically promote Zhumadian rural tourism using official TikTok and Weibo accounts. Publish content such as attraction introductions, tourism activities, and visitor experiences, showcasing the charm of rural areas through short videos and visual posts. Regularly host online interactive activities, such as lotteries and live broadcasts, to boost public engagement. 7 experts believe the policy is reasonable, while 2 experts suggest that since official accounts represent the government’s image, it is important to emphasize \"high- quality\" content in the posts. Adding the term \"high- quality\" highlights the significance of maintaining content standards and the overall image. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the overall quantitative data, the findings derived from the data collected from both tourists and residents reveal several key insights: About tourism services in Zhumadian, despite a plentiful supply of local service personnel, a significant number of tourists expressed a desire for enhancements in service quality and offerings. In particular, areas such as the comfort of accommodations, digital services, and infrastructure were identified as critical domains in need of improvement. This observation is consistent with the analysis conducted by Zhang (2023) in their study “Spatial Distribution and Optimization Strategies of Rural Leisure Tourism in Beijing.” Utilizing Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 quantitative analysis methods, their research suggests that rural tourism accommodations significantly depend on the appeal of nationally recognized scenic spots and the convenience of transportation. They found that the most successful homestays are typically situated in plain and mountainous agricultural areas, which are heavily influenced by the attraction of national-level tourist destinations, although they noted a need for enhancements in the transportation network. Furthermore, this aligns with Liu’s (2023) work on “Sustainable Development Strategies for Rural Tourism in Yu County under the Background of Rural Revitalization,” which indicates that improving service quality necessitates unified planning, enhanced infrastructure, the development of innovative products, the establishment of year-round tourist attractions, and the creation of a highly skilled workforce. Additionally, Zhang (2023) proposed effective strategies in “Strategies for Rural Revitalization Driven by Rural Tourism Development” through quantitative analysis that includes scientific planning and layout, diversified product development, bolstering infrastructure construction, introducing professional management models, fostering entrepreneurial growth, and enhancing brand recognition. Moreover, the advancement of information technology represents a fundamental area requiring reinforcement in rural tourism. This perspective is supported by Zhu and Shang (2021) in their analysis “Smart Rural Tourism under the Background of Internet+,” which evaluated the performance of rural smart tourism systems through experimental analysis and emphasized the importance of intelligent services in this sector. Collectively, these studies underscore the necessity of improving service quality and infrastructure, illuminating their pivotal role in boosting tourist satisfaction and fostering sustainable development within the tourism industry. In the ongoing evolution of rural tourism in Zhumadian, a significant involvement of residents, predominantly older adults, has been observed. Despite their overall positive attitude towards this development, several challenges persist. These include the absence of comprehensive personnel management systems, well-defined performance evaluation criteria, and effective talent motivation mechanisms. Such deficiencies hinder the fulfillment of individual employee needs and aspirations.",
    "This scenario echoes the insights offered by Wilson, Fesenmaier, and their colleagues in 2001. Their study, “Factors for Successful Rural Tourism Development,” underscores the criticality of community engagement for the sustained growth of destination tourism. Wilson emphasized that community participation is pivotal to tourism development success, with rural tourism and entrepreneurship relying heavily on the collaboration of directly and indirectly involved entrepreneurs. Since the 1970s, the economic challenges faced by rural communities have persisted, making alternative development strategies like tourism and entrepreneurship crucial in addressing these issues (Wilson, 2001). Furthermore, our findings align with the analysis conducted by Gong and Li in 2014, exploring various levels of participation and their inherent dynamics in the context of Shandong Province’s homestay industry. Their study proposes targeted measures to address rural tourism service management challenges. These perspectives resonate with the specific needs expressed by residents to enhance the organization of tourism projects, such as providing clearer activity information and bolstering personnel training. This underscores the vital role of resident participation in driving tourism development. Zhumadian’s rural tourism is enriched with historical, cultural, and local distinctiveness. However, it currently offers a limited spectrum of tourism products and itineraries. Themed rural tourism, centered on local cultural attributes, remains scarce. We recommend that future policies focus on elevating the quality and diversity of tourism offerings, providing a broader range of choices for tourists. This approach will foster the sustainable progress of the tourism industry, furthering the advancement of rural tourism in Zhumadian and yielding broader economic and cultural benefits for local communities. These recommendations align with the views expressed by Guo and Han in their 2010 overview of rural tourism development in China (Guo and Han. 2010). To expand the horizons of rural tourism in Zhumadian, we suggest introducing a more diverse array of options. These could include parent-child amusement parks, family farms, wellness resorts, health hiking tours, and immersive cultural experiences. This approach involves exploring and celebrating the cultural significance of local features, preserving rural tourism heritage, and leveraging the government’s proactive role in enhancing environmental awareness. Strengthening government guidance to implement policy planning, developing digital information platforms, and promoting data openness and sharing are also essential for ensuring sustainable rural tourism Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 Through qualitative research methods, including document analysis, interviews, and discussions, we have gathered valuable insights from key informants such as residents and tourism participants. Our findings reveal several challenges facing rural tourism development, including policy inconsistencies and inadequate development efforts. Issues such as underutilized cultural resources, insufficient renovation projects, difficulty in coordinating diverse interests, the outflow of young and middle-aged rural populations, and weak promotional efforts have surfaced during our research. We recommend that government departments prioritize planning and guidance, bolster key industry development, and adhere to eco-friendly strategies and related recommendations. These resources are pivotal for advancing rural tourism in Zhumadian, echoing the perspectives of Wang, Deng, and their colleagues, as well as Yang, in their recent analyses of high-quality rural tourism development in Fuzhou, Fujian Province (Wang, 2023). We propose adopting flexible operational strategies such as contracted operations, enterprise management, commissioned operations, or leasing spaces. These approaches can facilitate the introduction of more investment projects and services, ultimately increasing residents’ income. This viewpoint aligns with the analysis conducted by Wang, Deng, and their team on the value, challenges, and strategies of rural sports tourism in supporting rural revitalization. the development of rural sports tourism, as discussed by Wang and Wang in 2023, demands the integration of “sports, tourism, and agriculture.” This approach requires embracing new development concepts, implementing a talent-driven tourism strategy, establishing benefit-sharing coordination mechanisms, and achieving the seamless integration of rural industries. Addressing issues such as the homogenization of tourism products, enhancing the soft power of rural sports culture, and establishing a collaborative governance model for rural sports tourism are also crucial considerations in this regard (Wang and Wang (2023). In conclusion, the successful implementation of the Zhumadian Rural Tourism Policy Guide hinges on a multi-faceted approach that integrates robust policy formulation and execution. First, effective policy publicity is essential; it facilitates the dissemination of information regarding the policies’ goals and content to all stakeholders, thereby fostering awareness and engagement. Additionally, breaking down the guiding policies into specific operational procedures with clearly defined tasks is critical for ensuring that all participants understand their roles, thus promoting a structured implementation process.",
    "Furthermore, adequate organizational and material preparations play a pivotal role in supporting the successful execution of these policies. Establishing specialized teams and providing necessary training enhances the overall implementation capacity, while sufficient financial and physical resources act as foundational support for realizing the policies’ objectives. Engaging in policy experimentation through pilot programs allows for the collection of valuable data that can inform adjustments, ensuring that the policies are both effective and adaptable to the local context. Lastly, the comprehensive implementation of Zhumadian’s rural tourism policies demands continuous evaluation and feedback mechanisms. By fostering effective communication among stakeholders and establishing monitoring processes, potential issues can be promptly addressed, facilitating timely corrections and improvements. This holistic approach not only ensures the successful application of the guiding policies but also lays the groundwork for sustainable rural tourism development in Zhumadian. 1. Strengthen Policy Formulation and Publicity. Enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of policy guidelines by breaking them down into specific operational procedures, ensuring clear task division and work processes. Utilize multiple communication channels to effectively promote the policies, ensuring all stakeholders are well-informed about their content and objectives. 2. Prioritize Organizational and Material Preparations. Establish dedicated teams and provide necessary training to enhance the implementation capacity and efficiency of the policies. Ensure adequate material support, including financial and physical resources, to facilitate the smooth execution of rural tourism management guidelines. 3. Implement Pilot Programs and Monitor Effectiveness. Conduct pilot experiments to test the adaptability and effectiveness of the policies. Establish a robust monitoring and inspection Zhang, Z., Kheovichai, K., & Chantasorn, N. (2025). Guidelines Policy for Rural Tourism in Zhumadian. International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews, 5 (3), 405-416; DOI: https://doi.org/10.60027/ijsasr.2025.5898 4. Enhance Coordination and Reporting Mechanisms. Foster effective communication and coordination both internally within departments and externally with the public to ensure smooth policy implementation. Systematically compile and analyze evaluation results, providing detailed reports with actionable suggestions for policy improvements and adjustments to optimize future implementation efforts."
