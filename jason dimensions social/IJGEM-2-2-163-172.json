    "This paper aims to explore the problems existing in the development of rural e-commerce in Henan Province and propose corresponding solutions. Through the integration of existing research results, combined with field surveys and case analyses, it deeply analyzes the challenges and difficulties in the development of rural e-commerce in Henan Province, thereby providing theoretical support and practical guidance for further development in this field. With the continuous development and popularization of information technology, e-commerce has become an important force driving economic development and social progress. Especially in rural areas, e-commerce provides convenient shopping channels for farmers, expands sales markets, and promotes rural economic development. However, the development of rural e-commerce in Henan Province also faces a series of problems and challenges. How to effectively solve these problems and promote the healthy development of rural e-commerce has become one of the urgent issues to be addressed. Infrastructure is the foundation that supports and promotes economic, social, and environmental development. A well-established logistics network can enhance the efficiency of e-commerce transactions and reduce transportation costs; a comprehensive payment system directly impacts user transaction experiences and trust in the platform; stable and efficient network connectivity ensures smooth online transactions. The improvement of these infrastructures directly promotes the development and prosperity of rural e-commerce. Therefore, the development of rural e-commerce in China urgently needs support from sound infrastructure. However, the current inadequate infrastructure has become one of the main obstacles. According to a study published by Cheng Sijia, Zhang Ruiwen and Shao Shuhui in the \"Agricultural Outlook\" in 2022, the analysis of the development path of rural e-commerce logistics in Henan Province shows that rural e-commerce infrastructure construction faces multiple challenges. Insufficient coverage of logistics networks leads to low freight efficiency and prolonged transaction Content from this work may be used under the terms of CC BY-NC 4.0 licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). fata Published by Warwick Evans Publishing. cycles; the low penetration rate of electronic payment systems restricts the convenience of online transactions; issues with internet access speed and stability affect user experience and business stability.[1] The solution requires increased investment to improve rural e-commerce infrastructure, including strengthening logistics networks, promoting electronic payment systems, and optimizing internet access facilities to enhance delivery efficiency, penetration rate, and user experience. These measures will effectively promote the healthy development of rural e-commerce and drive the upgrading of rural economies. Increasing investment in rural e-commerce infrastructure construction is a crucial step in promoting the development of rural e-commerce. It requires both government support and guidance, as well as active participation and investment from enterprises. Zhang Qian and Lin Meishun (2021) pointed out in their article titled \"Research on the Current Situation and Countermeasures of Rural E- commerce Logistics Development\" published in the journal \"Modern Marketing\" that the government should increase funding for rural e-commerce infrastructure construction and formulate relevant policies and regulations to provide a better environment and conditions for the development of e- commerce enterprises in rural areas.[2] Additionally, it is necessary to encourage and guide major e-commerce companies and local enterprises to increase investment in rural e-commerce infrastructure construction. This includes accelerating network construction, enhancing logistics and delivery capabilities, and promoting electronic payment methods. All of these investments can not only meet the basic needs of rural e- commerce development in the short term but also bring more employment opportunities and economic benefits to rural areas in the long run. Regarding accelerating network construction, the government can attract more network operators and equipment suppliers to participate in rural network construction through bidding and preferential policies, thereby improving network coverage and speed. At the same time, major e-commerce companies such as JD.com, Alibaba, and Pinduoduo can also increase investment in rural network infrastructure, jointly promoting the progress of network construction. Improving logistics and delivery capabilities is equally crucial as it directly impacts customers' online shopping experience. Therefore, the Henan provincial government and municipal governments should support logistics companies in rural areas to establish distribution centers and storage facilities, optimize delivery routes and service processes to enhance logistics efficiency and service quality. At the same time, e-commerce companies need to strengthen cooperation with logistics partners to overall improve logistics and delivery capabilities. Promoting electronic payment methods requires concerted efforts from the government and enterprises. The government should formulate relevant policies and regulations to support the widespread adoption and promotion of electronic payment tools (such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, UnionPay, etc.) and set up convenient electronic payment service points in rural areas. E-commerce companies should also actively promote electronic payment methods to provide users with more convenient and secure payment options.",
    "The development of rural e-commerce requires an increase in network coverage and speed, which are crucial aspects. To address this issue, the following measures are outlined in the \"China Internet Development Report\": 2.Reasonable network planning and layout schemes are necessary, taking into account factors such as terrain, population distribution, etc., to ensure broader and more stable network coverage.
