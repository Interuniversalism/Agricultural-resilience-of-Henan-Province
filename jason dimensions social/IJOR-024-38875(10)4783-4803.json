    "International Journal of Religion 2024 Volume: 5| Number 10 | pp. 4783 – 4803 ISSN: 2633-352X (Print) | ISSN: 2633-3538 (Online) ijor.co.uk DOI: https://doi.org/10.61707/fyga4n94 The implementation of China’s targeted poverty alleviation strategy has promoted changes in China’s poverty alleviation methods and influenced corporate poverty alleviation activities. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation in rural poor areas under the background of targeted poverty alleviation in China. Shangshui County in Henan Province, China, was selected as the research object. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods, an evaluation model of corporate poverty alleviation effectiveness was established through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on survey data. The results show that poverty alleviation enterprises in this county have played a significant role, but there is room for improvement. problems. It aims to accurately identify poverty targets, implement precise poverty alleviation measures, and manage poverty alleviation resources to achieve precise poverty alleviation for the poor population. Since its proposal in 2013, the targeted poverty alleviation policy has achieved significant results, effectively improving the production and living conditions of poor areas and promoting balanced socioeconomic development. However, poverty alleviation work is not achieved overnight; it requires multi-faceted efforts and continuous investment. As an important force in society, enterprises can provide funds, technology, and market support for poor areas, create employment opportunities, develop industries, and stimulate the endogenous power of poor areas for sustainable development. Shangshui County in Henan Province, as a typical rural poor county in central China, has its poverty alleviation work directly related to the poverty alleviation process of the region and even the entire central region. The corporate poverty alleviation activities in Shangshui County, through cooperation with the government and social organizations, have formed a multi-faceted poverty alleviation synergy, injecting new vitality into the development of poor areas. However, how effective is corporate poverty alleviation, what are the successful experiences and existing problems, and these questions are crucial for further optimizing poverty alleviation strategies and improving poverty alleviation efficiency. This study takes Shangshui County as an example to analyze the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation in depth, aiming to provide empirical research support for the implementation of targeted poverty alleviation policies and provide reference for poverty alleviation work in other regions. The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation projects implemented in rural poor areas of Shangshui County, Henan Province, under the background of targeted poverty alleviation. From the results of quantitative analysis, corporate poverty alleviation activities under the targeted poverty alleviation system have achieved certain successes, especially in promoting employment and increasing the income of poor households. However, there are also certain problems. These are mainly reflected in the low coverage rate of some corporate poverty alleviation projects for poor populations and the lack of enthusiasm for poverty alleviation among The key to evaluating the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation lies in understanding the sources and directions of corporate poverty alleviation funds. Comprehensive understanding of fund flows enables accurate measurement of the actual results of corporate poverty alleviation. This process is crucial not only for assessing the immediate effects of corporate poverty alleviation but also for exploring the sustainability and long-term impact of corporate poverty alleviation. In the process of enterprises participating in the development of rural poor areas, cooperation with local governments is the main mode of action. This cooperation mode has been proven effective in implementing targeted poverty alleviation strategies. According to existing research, corporate poverty alleviation strategies can be roughly divided into industrial poverty alleviation, e-commerce poverty alleviation, and pairing assistance. When conducting in-depth research on specific areas, it is important to combine the specific conditions of the area to conduct detailed investigations and research on how companies implement targeted poverty alleviation. Exploring the driving factors behind corporate poverty alleviation behaviors is crucial for understanding the intrinsic motivations of corporate poverty alleviation. These factors constitute the core motivation for companies to participate in poverty alleviation activities and provide research support for stimulating corporate enthusiasm in poverty alleviation work. Further, these studies have a positive impact on improving the efficiency of corporate poverty alleviation. In the academic field, discussions on corporate participation in poverty alleviation have yielded fruitful results, covering multiple dimensions of corporate poverty alleviation. However, there is still insufficient in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation, providing a broad space for further research. This study aims to inherit and borrow from existing literature, conduct innovative theoretical discussions and empirical research on the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation, and provide strategic guidance and reference for companies conducting poverty alleviation activities.",
    "In empirical research, this study selected a typical poor area as a case to explore in depth the poverty alleviation practices of companies in that area. By analyzing the current status and key measures taken by corporate poverty alleviation, this study aims to reveal the strategies and methods of corporate poverty alleviation. Additionally, this study uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to systematically analyze the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation and build an evaluation index system for corporate poverty alleviation performance. Based on this, the study innovatively expanded on the government poverty alleviation project evaluation index system and introduced subjective evaluation indicators such as public satisfaction to make the evaluation system more comprehensive and realistically reflect the social impact and actual effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation. Current research related to corporate poverty alleviation mainly focuses on the following aspects: examining the motivation for corporate poverty alleviation from the perspective of corporate social responsibility theory or the game between poverty alleviation subjects, encouraging companies to actively participate in poverty alleviation through incentive theory, and analyzing the poverty reduction effects of corporate poverty alleviation from the perspective of anti-poverty theory. Targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) has emerged as a key strategy in addressing poverty by focusing resources and efforts on the most impoverished segments of the population. This approach contrasts with broader poverty alleviation strategies by aiming to identify and assist specific individuals and households. TPA has been widely adopted, particularly in China, where it has become a central component of the government’s poverty reduction policy. Research on TPA primarily utilizes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods (Guo et al., 2022; Mitra et al., 2013). Several studies have highlighted the effectiveness of TPA in reducing poverty (Chang et al., 2022). For instance, Tang et al. (2022) found that TPA significantly improved income levels and living standards in targeted households. This success is often attributed to the precise identification of poverty-stricken households and the tailored support provided, such as financial aid, educational opportunities, and infrastructure development (Li and Li, 2021). However, the implementation of TPA is not without challenges. The accuracy of targeting mechanisms is crucial, as misidentification can lead to resource misallocation (Li et al., 2023). Additionally, the sustainability of poverty alleviation efforts remains a concern, with some households falling back into poverty once support is withdrawn (Fan et al., 2023). Li et al. (2023) suggested that continuous support mechanisms need to be developed to prevent this relapse. Moreover, the bureaucratic complexity and potential for corruption in the implementation process have been noted as significant obstacles (Makhubu, 2021; Odalonu and Obani, 2018). The Chinese government plays a crucial role in motivating corporate poverty alleviation (CPA) through policies and incentives. The government’s strategic plans, such as the “Targeted Poverty Alleviation” initiative, encourage businesses to participate in poverty reduction efforts by offering tax incentives, subsidies, and other benefits (Wang and Ye, 2024). Studies show that government directives significantly influence corporate behavior, aligning business activities with national development goals (Chang et al., 2021; Jing et al., 2023). Many companies view CPA as an integral part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategies, aiming to improve their public image, enhance stakeholder relationships, and fulfill ethical obligations. CSR-driven poverty alleviation helps companies build a positive brand reputation and gain consumer trust, which can lead to increased market share and profitability (Chen and Wang, 2011). Economic benefits and market expansion also motivate companies to engage in poverty alleviation. The investment of corporations in regions that are struggling with poverty results in gaining access to new markets, establishing a steady supply chain, and enhancing competitive advantages. Poverty alleviation efforts often lead to the development of local economies, which in turn provides businesses with a more prosperous consumer base and potential workforce (Li et al., 2019). Social and cultural factors, including traditional Chinese values and community expectations, play a significant role in motivating corporate poverty alleviation. The concept of “Confucian benevolence” encourages businesses to contribute to social well-being and community development (Su et al., 2023). Additionally, societal expectations and pressure from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media can drive companies to adopt poverty alleviation initiatives (Ling, 2019; Zhang, 2017; Bergman et al., 2015). CSR can significantly enhance community well-being when aligned with a company's fundamental goals. Mirza et al. (2023) revealed that CSR efforts in education, health, and economic empowerment not only improve living standards but also elevate corporate value through better stakeholder relationships and enhanced reputation. This concept aligns with the resource-based theory, suggesting that CSR can provide sustainable competitive advantages (Greening & Turban, 2000).",
    "Bugg-Levine and Emerson (2011) demonstrated that impact investments in affordable housing and healthcare sectors markedly enhance living conditions and economic stability. Clark et al. (2004) provided evidence of successful impact investments delivering measurable social benefits. Mirza et al. (2023) emphasized that engaging low-income communities can create sustainable income sources. Additionally, microfinance and microenterprise development are pivotal, as highlighted by Yunus (2007), who documented the success of microfinance in fostering entrepreneurship and job creation. The effectiveness of CPA is often hindered by poor design and misalignment with local needs. Porter and Kramer (2006) argued that CSR initiatives must be integrated into core business strategies to create shared value. Traditional CSR activities sometimes fail to address the fundamental causes of poverty effectively, underscoring the need for more strategic approaches. Many corporate initiatives encounter difficulties in sustaining and scaling their impact. Long-term success requires a deep understanding of local contexts and ongoing community engagement (Porter & Kramer, 2006). Accurate measurement of the impact of poverty alleviation efforts is complex, and standardized metrics along with transparent reporting are essential for ensuring these initiatives effectively address the root causes of poverty (Clark et al., 2004). This study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, using survey data to construct a corporate poverty alleviation effectiveness evaluation model and conduct quantitative research on corporate poverty alleviation activities in Shangshui County to assess its actual effectiveness. The AHP is divided into four steps: Firstly, establishing the hierarchical structure model is the initial stage of this study. This model divides the index system for evaluating corporate poverty alleviation effectiveness into two levels, where the index layer is constrained by the criterion layer, and the indicators at each level remain independent. The goal layer aims to evaluate the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation in Shangshui County. The criterion layer is further subdivided into five main indicators, while the index layer expands to 16 sub-indicators. Secondly, constructing the judgment matrix is a key step in the research process. The construction of this matrix is crucial for accurately assessing the importance of each indicator and the precision of the final results. Based on expert scoring, the relative importance of each indicator within the index layer is determined, and their reciprocals are used as measurement standards. This standard reflects the relationships between different levels of indicators and is used to construct an n-order judgment matrix. Finally, through calculation, the maximum eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector are obtained to complete the analysis process. The AHP includes four steps as shown in Fig. 1. Thirdly, the weight vector is calculated. After processing using the aggregation method, the weight vector is obtained through two normalizations of the column vector and the new matrix. After processing the weight vector, the consistency check is obtained. The corresponding λmax is obtained as: Generally, the value of CI, is positively correlated with the consistency of the judgment matrix. The larger the value, the stronger the consistency, and the more reasonable the structure of the matrix. Since the judgment matrix may produce random deviations, a consistency ratio CR is established to compare CI with RI, representing the consistency of the matrix, as shown in equation 4. The CR value is a measure of the consistency of the judgment matrix, used to determine whether the matrix meets the consistency test requirements. If the CR value is less than 0.1, the matrix meets the consistency standard; if the CR value exceeds 0.1, the matrix does not meet the consistency requirements. Additionally, the average random consistency index RI is proportional to the size of the judgment matrix. As the matrix order n increases, the RI value also increases, indicating a higher possibility of random deviation. Once the judgment matrix passes the consistency test, the weight vector corresponding to λmax can be confirmed. The average value and the CI are shown in Table 3. In determining the evaluation system for the effectiveness of corporate poverty alleviation efforts, this study primarily selected indicators based on aspects such as precise identification of poverty alleviation projects, precise assistance, regional economic development status, and poverty alleviation outcomes. Additionally, considering the actual conditions of corporate poverty alleviation and the feasibility of field research, the evaluation system was ultimately established. After a thorough analysis of key indicators such as the effectiveness of corporate aid to impoverished groups, accurate identification of poor households, and the outcomes of poverty alleviation, the comprehensive evaluation indicators were categorized into five categories: precise identification, precise assistance, capital investment, poverty reduction effect, and public satisfaction.",
    "This study defined the effectiveness evaluation system for corporate poverty alleviation into 5 primary indicators and 16 secondary indicators, as shown in Table 4. Based on the established evaluation indicator system, the AHP, which is well-suited for this purpose, was selected to solve the evaluation indicator system. The steps are as follows (step 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5): To determine the weights of the indicators in both the criterion layer and the index layer, the expert scoring method was used to establish a judgment matrix for each layer according to AHP standards. The geometric mean method was then used to calculate the weight of each indicator, followed by a consistency check based on the consistency principle. The weight calculation and consistency check process for the criterion layer and index layer are as follows: Step 3: Judgment Matrix and Weight Calculation for Poverty Alleviation Funds: Based on expert evaluations, the judgment matrix for poverty alleviation funds is as follows: Step 5: Judgment Matrix and Weight Calculation for Public Satisfaction: According to expert evaluations, the judgement matrix for public satisfaction is: According to the calculation results, the summary of the criterion layer and indicator layer weights for the enterprise poverty alleviation effect evaluation index system in this region is shown in Table 5: Shangshui County in Henan Province, a traditional large county mainly based on agriculture, has relatively backward infrastructure due to its remote geographical location and inconvenient transportation. The residents’ education level and labor quality are relatively low, the industry is single, and it faces a serious problem of young and middle-aged labor force loss. It is one of the key areas for poverty alleviation and development in China. Although Shangshui County has effectively reduced the number of poor people and lowered the poverty rate through enterprise poverty alleviation measures, its poverty rate is still relatively high compared to other impoverished counties in the city. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen enterprise poverty alleviation measures and encourage more enterprises to participate in poverty alleviation work to promote poverty alleviation in the county. The poverty situation in Shangshui County over the years is shown in Table 6. The research covered the basic situation of the respondents’ families, annual income, participation in enterprise poverty alleviation projects, poverty rate, and multidimensional data on the participation of poor households in enterprise poverty alleviation obtained through questionnaires. It also included the effectiveness data of some participating enterprises in poverty alleviation. The study of the assisted poor households was mainly conducted through questionnaires. Considering the wide distribution of enterprises involved in poverty alleviation, telephone interviews were mainly used for the survey of enterprises. A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed in this survey, and 146 valid questionnaires were finally collected, with an effective recovery rate of 73%. The majority of the respondents in this survey were women, accounting for 63%, while men accounted for 37%. The distribution is given in Table 7 It can be seen that, in terms of age distribution, the majority of people are in the 41–50 age group, accounting for 43.15%. The proportion of people aged 31–40 is 35.62%, those aged 51–60 is 7.53%, and those aged 20– 30 is 13.70%. Figure 2 shows educational levels distribution of the participants in this region. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that, in terms of educational attainment, the population in this region is mainly comprised of individuals with junior high school and primary school education backgrounds. Specifically, the proportion of people with a junior high school education is the highest, reaching 41.78%, while those with a primary school education account for 36.97%. The proportion of people with a high school education or above is relatively low, at only 8.92%, and those who have not received any education make up 12.33%. The overall low level of education is one of the main factors leading to the frequent poverty issues in this region and is also a key obstacle to local development. The distribution of the poverty causing factors is given in Figure 3. It can be seen that the main causes of poverty include illness and educational burdens. Specifically, the proportion of poverty caused by illness or disability reaches 26.03%, and that caused by educational burdens is 21.23%, together accounting for more than half.",
    "Poverty due to a lack of professional skills accounts for 17.81%, while other reasons account for 34.93%. This indicates that illness and educational expenses are the primary factors leading to family poverty, as they not only reduce the family’s labor force but also increase the economic burden. It can be observed that among the surveyed population, 118 people reported a significant improvement in their lives after participating in enterprise poverty alleviation projects. This number accounts for 80.8% of the total surveyed population, reflecting that most poor families can indeed benefit substantially from these poverty alleviation projects. The effect of the poverty alleviation training skills is outlined in Table 9. It can be seen that a total of 104 respondents confirmed that they received vocational training and acquired new professional skills through the poverty alleviation projects. This shows that enterprise poverty alleviation projects play a positive role in providing skill training to most poor families, helping to enhance their self- development capabilities. The levels of satisfaction with poverty alleviation among respondents is represented in Fig. 5. On the basis of constructing the evaluation system framework, this study allocated weights to each indicator according to expert evaluations and conducted a consistency check to ensure the rationality of the indicators. Subsequently, all indicators were comprehensively ranked to determine their relative importance in the evaluation system and to identify the indicators that have the greatest impact on the evaluation results, providing a foundation for further effectiveness evaluation. Based on this, quantifiable indicators were selected for in- depth study, and ten key indicators were finally selected, covering all criterion layers. The article will focus on analyzing these 10 indicators to evaluate the poverty alleviation effectiveness of the selected 10 enterprises. The data on the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation in Shangshui County is shown in Table 10. Due to the differences in units and nature of each indicator, and the presence of both positive and negative indicators, it is not possible to effectively calculate the data for each indicator. The data of relative and absolute indicators are normalized using the following formula: 𝑦 = 𝑥𝑖−min(𝑥𝑖) max(𝑥𝑖)−min(𝑥𝑖) , where 𝑦 is the normalized value, 𝑥𝑖 is the original value of the 𝑖-th indicator, min 𝑥𝑖 is the minimum value of the 𝑖-th indicator, and max 𝑥𝑖 is the maximum value of the 𝑖-th indicator, to obtain dimensionless data, which allows for unified calculation. The processing formulas for positive and negative indicators are 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖−min(𝑥𝑖) max(𝑥𝑖)−min(𝑥𝑖) and 𝑦𝑖 = max(𝑥𝑖)−𝑥𝑖 max(𝑥𝑖)−min(𝑥𝑖) . Respectively. The positive and negative indicator formulas are used to process the data, and the processed evaluation data is given in Table 11. After the collected data is processed to be dimensionless, the weights of each indicator are calculated using the AHP. A comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation in Shangshui County is conducted using three different levels of indicator evaluation indices. The calculation method of the comprehensive evaluation index is as follows: where 𝑆 represents the evaluation index of each indicator, 𝑝 refers to the weight of each indicator, and 𝑋𝑖 denotes the dimensionless indicator values. With this, first, second, and third-level indicators are tested with their respective effectiveness indices in analyzing the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation in Shangshui County. A comprehensive evaluation index of three level indicators is given in Table 12. In terms of the Poverty Population Identification Rate (B11), Qiaogu Clothing Company scores the highest, showing strong identification capabilities, while ZhenGuo Fishing Net Company scores the lowest, indicating a need for improvement in this area. Regarding the Poverty Population Exit Rate (B12), the Non-woven Fabric Clothing Company scores the highest, implying a strong ability to help people exit poverty. Conversely, Jingtian Toy Factory scores the lowest, suggesting that their poverty alleviation efforts need to be strengthened. In the tertiary indicators of precise assistance, the data on the Coverage of Registered Poor Households (B22) shows that Alben Clothing Company scores the highest, demonstrating outstanding performance in covering registered poor households. In contrast, Yigang Company scores the lowest, indicating room for improvement in this area. For the indicator of Employment Promotion for Poor Households (B24), Alben Clothing Company scores the highest, showing excellent performance in promoting employment among poor households, while Yigang Company needs further improvement.",
    "Regarding the indicators related to poverty alleviation funds, Yigang and Xinwei Companies score the highest in the indicator of Enterprise Poverty Alleviation Funds Arrival (B31), reflecting good timeliness and adequacy of their poverty alleviation funds. In contrast, ZhenGuo Company scores the lowest, indicating poor performance in fund arrival. In the indicator of Enterprise Poverty Alleviation Fund Investment (B32), Alben Clothing Company leads with the highest score, showing proactive investment in funds, while Yigang Company scores low, indicating the need for improvement in fund investment. In the tertiary indicators evaluating the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation, Qiaogu Clothing Company scores relatively high in the Poverty Population Return Rate (B41), possibly indicating a higher rate of return to poverty for its projects. In contrast, Yuyang Fisheries scores low, showing better performance in reducing the return to poverty. Regarding the Income Growth of Poor Population (B42), the Non-woven Fabric Clothing Company scores the highest, indicating significant success in increasing the income of poor households. In contrast, Jingtian Company scores low, suggesting limited effectiveness in promoting income growth. For the Reduction in Registered Poor Population (B43), Alben Company achieves the highest score, showing the greatest success in reducing the number of poor households, while Jingtian Toy Factory scores the lowest, indicating slower progress in this area. In terms of public satisfaction, the satisfaction of poor households with Alben Company’s poverty alleviation efforts (B53) is the highest, showing high recognition. Conversely, Yigang Company scores the lowest in this indicator, implying the need for further improvement and optimization of their poverty alleviation work. Based on the data from Table 13, we find that in the secondary indicators of precise identification, the Non- woven Fabric Clothing Company performs the best, with a score more than six times that of Day Force Company, indicating a significant difference between the two companies in precise identification. In the secondary indicators of precise assistance, Alben Company scores the highest among the 10 companies compared, demonstrating the most effective implementation of precise assistance measures in poverty alleviation. On the other hand, Yigang Company scores the lowest, suggesting a need for further improvement in precise assistance. Regarding the indicators of poverty alleviation fund investment, Alben Clothing Company leads with the highest value, showing excellent performance in both fund investment and fund arrival, while ZhenGuo Fishing Net Factory scores the lowest, indicating areas that need further improvement. In the indicators measuring poverty reduction effectiveness, Alben Clothing Company again stands out with the highest value, reflecting the effectiveness and significant impact of its poverty reduction measures. Meanwhile, Jingtian Toy Factory scores lower in this indicator, suggesting room for improvement in its poverty reduction outcomes. In terms of public satisfaction indicators, Alben Clothing Company receives the highest satisfaction rating, indicating that the poor households highly appreciate and recognize its poverty alleviation efforts. In contrast, Yigang Company has the lowest public satisfaction, which may imply that the poor households do not highly recognize its poverty alleviation work, indicating a need for actions to improve its image and satisfaction among Based on the analysis of Table 14, Alben Clothing Company ranks at the top, demonstrating its outstanding effectiveness in poverty alleviation efforts. The company excels in several key indicators, including poverty population identification rate, exit rate, coverage of registered poor households, and satisfaction with poverty alleviation work. This reflects its excellent performance in fulfilling its poverty alleviation responsibilities, resulting in a high overall evaluation score. Qiaogu Clothing Company scores high in both the poverty population identification rate and satisfaction with poverty alleviation work, placing it relatively high in the rankings as well. Alben Clothing Company also performs well in areas such as coverage of registered poor households, promoting employment among poor households, and investment in poverty alleviation funds. These factors collectively contribute to its high overall ranking. In contrast, Yuyang Company ranks lower in indicators such as promoting employment among poor households, coverage of registered poor households, and the rate of return to poverty among assisted poor households. This suggests that its poverty alleviation strategies may need adjustment and optimization to improve its effectiveness in poverty alleviation. where 𝑤𝑗 is the weight coefficient of the j-th category index, 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is the weight coefficient of the j-th item index in the i-th category, and 𝐶𝑖𝑗 is the dimensionless value of the j-th item index in the i-th category. 𝐾𝑖 is the poverty alleviation effect of the i-th enterprise in Shangshui County. The poverty alleviation effect of enterprises in Shangshui County is shown in Table 15.",
    "In the assessment of enterprise poverty alleviation effectiveness, a weight of 15.2% was assigned to the accuracy of identification, highlighting its importance in poverty alleviation efforts. A comprehensive analysis of data from ten enterprises shows that these companies perform relatively well in identifying poor households, with an average identification rate of 75.7%. However, contrasting this is the exit rate of the poor population, which is only 66%, meaning that about 10% of the identified poor population has not successfully escaped poverty. This discrepancy reveals shortcomings in the execution of poverty alleviation efforts by enterprises, indicating that they have not fully achieved their expected targets. Several factors may contribute to this execution gap. Firstly, it could be due to a lack of sufficient specificity and effectiveness in the design and implementation of poverty alleviation projects by enterprises, leading to unmet needs of the poor households. Secondly, it may result from unreasonable allocation of poverty alleviation resources or insufficient utilization of poverty alleviation funds. Additionally, the communication and connection between enterprises and poor households might not be close enough, causing poverty alleviation measures to fail to be accurately implemented. Under the new poverty alleviation framework, enterprises need to more precisely align with targeted poverty alleviation projects to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their efforts. To achieve this goal, enterprises should take the following measures: Strengthen communication with poor households to deeply understand their needs and difficulties, enabling the design of more practical poverty alleviation plans. Optimize the allocation of poverty alleviation resources to ensure that every penny invested can maximize its utility and avoid resource wastage. Establish and improve the supervision and evaluation mechanisms of poverty alleviation projects, regularly checking the progress and effectiveness of poverty alleviation work, and promptly identifying and solving problems. Enhance the training of poverty alleviation staff to improve their professional abilities and service awareness, ensuring the quality of poverty alleviation work. Encourage and guide more social forces to participate in poverty alleviation work, forming a collaborative effort involving the government, enterprises, and society. Through these measures, enterprises can continuously improve the accuracy and effectiveness of poverty alleviation work, better fulfilling their social responsibilities and contributing more to social equity and progress. At the same time, this can enhance the brand image and social influence of enterprises, laying a solid foundation for their long-term development. In summary, although enterprise poverty alleviation work has achieved certain results, it still faces many challenges and problems. Only through continuous improvement and innovation can enterprises go further on the road to poverty alleviation and achieve truly sustainable development. In the constructed evaluation system, precision assistance indicators account for 8% of the weight. Although this proportion is not the highest, its importance cannot be overlooked. The effectiveness of precision assistance directly impacts the overall success of poverty alleviation efforts. Among the evaluated enterprises, Alben Garment Company stands out in terms of precision assistance, leading the rankings primarily due to its extensive coverage of poor households and significant contribution to employment for poor households. Precision assistance is a crucial aspect of poverty alleviation work. It requires that assistance measures precisely target the actual needs of poor households, ensuring the efficient utilization of aid resources. Only when assistance measures are effectively implemented and touch the lives of poor households does poverty alleviation work become meaningful and its effects visible. Enterprises that perform poorly in precision assistance often have unsatisfactory overall rankings. This clearly indicates that the accuracy of assistance is crucial for achieving effective poverty alleviation outcomes. In-depth Understanding of Poor Households: Enterprises need to thoroughly understand the specific conditions of poor households, including their living conditions, income levels, educational backgrounds, health statuses, etc., to more accurately identify their needs. Develop Personalized Assistance Plans: Based on a deep understanding of poor households, enterprises should develop personalized assistance plans that consider the specific needs and potential abilities of the households. Implement Effective Assistance Measures: Enterprises should implement a series of effective assistance measures, such as providing employment opportunities, skills training, educational support, and health security, to help poor households enhance their self-development capabilities. Establish Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanisms: Enterprises need to establish a set of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to regularly track the implementation and effectiveness of assistance measures, ensuring that the assistance work proceeds as planned and is adjusted and improved in a timely manner.",
    "Strengthen Cooperation with Government and Social Organizations: Enterprises should strengthen cooperation with the government, social organizations, and other stakeholders to form a concerted effort in poverty alleviation, jointly promoting the effective implementation of assistance measures. Encourage Participation and Feedback from Poor Households: Enterprises should encourage poor households to participate in the formulation and implementation of assistance plans while actively collecting their feedback to ensure that the assistance measures truly meet their needs. In the evaluation system of poverty alleviation projects, indicators related to poverty alleviation funds account for 14.2% of the weight. This proportion highlights the core position of funds in poverty alleviation work. The investment and management of poverty alleviation funds are key factors in ensuring the smooth progress of poverty alleviation projects, directly relating to whether the projects can achieve their set goals. Alben Garment Company’s high ranking in poverty alleviation funds reflects not only its proactive attitude towards fund investment but also its significant contribution to its overall high ranking. However, not all enterprises can make sufficient investments in poverty alleviation funds like Alben Garment. Some enterprises face difficulties in sustaining their poverty alleviation projects due to insufficient funding or untimely fund allocation, which hinders the expected impact of the projects. This situation not only affects the continuity and stability of poverty alleviation efforts but also weakens the effectiveness of poverty alleviation, potentially leading to the failure of the projects. Therefore, the investment and management of poverty alleviation funds are crucial to ensuring the smooth operation of poverty alleviation projects. Enterprises must place high importance on the investment of poverty alleviation funds to ensure their adequacy and timeliness. Specifically, enterprises can take the following measures: Ensure Sufficient Funds: Enterprises should reasonably plan and allocate poverty alleviation funds based on their financial status and the actual needs of poverty alleviation projects to ensure fund adequacy. Optimize Fund Allocation: Enterprises should reasonably allocate funds according to the specific conditions of poverty alleviation projects, prioritizing the needs of key areas and critical links. Strengthen Fund Management: Enterprises should establish sound fund management systems, enhance supervision and auditing of funds, and ensure the safe and compliant use of funds. Improve Fund Utilization Efficiency: Enterprises should improve the efficiency of fund utilization through scientifically reasonable fund use plans to maximize the benefits of the funds. Establish Fund Guarantee Mechanisms: Enterprises should establish stable fund guarantee mechanisms to ensure continuous investment in poverty alleviation funds and prevent project interruptions due to funding issues. Strengthen Cooperation with Government and Financial Institutions: Enterprises should enhance cooperation with government and financial institutions to gain more policy and funding support and broaden funding sources. Encourage Social Capital Participation: Enterprises should encourage and guide social capital to participate in poverty alleviation projects, forming a diversified funding input mechanism to enhance the security of poverty alleviation funds. Establish Risk Response Mechanisms: Enterprises should establish risk response mechanisms to warn and respond to potential funding risks, ensuring the safety of poverty alleviation funds. Through these measures, enterprises can not only ensure the adequacy and timeliness of poverty alleviation funds but also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fund utilization, providing solid financial guarantees for the smooth progress of poverty alleviation projects. This not only helps to enhance the social responsibility image of enterprises but also brings long-term social and economic benefits to them. In conclusion, the investment and management of poverty alleviation funds are important components of enterprise poverty alleviation work. Enterprises must give them sufficient attention and take effective measures to ensure that poverty alleviation funds can play their maximum role. Poverty reduction effectiveness indicators occupy a crucial position in the evaluation system, with a weight of 49.6%, almost half of the entire evaluation system. The quality of this indicator is directly related to the ultimate effectiveness of poverty alleviation work, making it the core of all evaluation indicators. The performance of enterprises in poverty reduction effectiveness not only determines their ranking in this indicator but also plays a decisive role in their overall ranking in the comprehensive evaluation system. For example, the high overall rankings of Alben Garment and Huadong Non-woven Fabric are largely due to their excellent performance in poverty reduction effectiveness. Poverty reduction effectiveness is a direct and key indicator for measuring the success of an enterprise’s poverty alleviation efforts. It can clearly reflect whether substantial progress and results have been achieved. The more significant an enterprise’s poverty reduction effectiveness, the higher the success of its poverty alleviation work. This must be given full attention and priority in evaluations.",
    "Clarify Poverty Reduction Goals: Enterprises should set clear poverty reduction goals based on their actual situation and the characteristics of their poverty alleviation projects, including short-term and long-term goals. Develop Scientific Poverty Reduction Plans: Enterprises should formulate scientific and reasonable poverty reduction plans, specifying concrete measures, paths, and methods for poverty reduction to ensure orderly progress. Strengthen Implementation of Poverty Reduction Projects: Enterprises should enhance the organization and implementation of poverty reduction projects to ensure effective execution of various poverty reduction measures and achieve the expected results. Establish a Poverty Reduction Effectiveness Evaluation Mechanism: Enterprises should set up evaluation mechanisms for poverty reduction effectiveness, regularly assessing and summarizing the effectiveness, and timely adjusting and optimizing poverty reduction measures. Strengthen Cooperation with Other Poverty Alleviation Entities: Enterprises should strengthen cooperation with government, social organizations, and other enterprises to form a combined effort in poverty alleviation, jointly promoting the enhancement of poverty reduction effectiveness. Encourage Innovation and Exploration: Enterprises should encourage innovation and exploration in poverty reduction work, continuously trying new models and methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of poverty reduction. Emphasize Participation and Feedback from Poor Households: Enterprises should focus on the participation and feedback of poor households, respecting their wishes and choices to ensure that poverty reduction measures truly meet their needs. Through these measures, enterprises can effectively enhance poverty reduction effectiveness and achieve the ultimate goal of poverty alleviation work. Enhancing poverty reduction effectiveness not only helps improve the living conditions of poor households and promote social equity and progress but also enhances the social responsibility image of enterprises and strengthens their sustainable development capability. Therefore, enterprises must attach great importance to poverty reduction effectiveness, making it a top priority in poverty alleviation work, and adopt practical and effective measures to continuously improve poverty reduction effectiveness, contributing to the achievement of comprehensive poverty alleviation goals. Public satisfaction, as a key subjective indicator of measuring the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation efforts, is of great importance. It is not only a crucial metric for evaluating the success of enterprise poverty alleviation but also a necessary condition for ensuring substantial success in poverty alleviation work. Only when poverty alleviation efforts have gained widespread recognition and satisfaction from the public can we say that the work has met its intended goals and achieved a satisfactory completion. In the evaluation of enterprise poverty alleviation effectiveness, enterprises with high rankings often also excel in public satisfaction. This reflects their deep understanding of the ultimate goal of poverty alleviation work ensuring that poor households genuinely benefit. However, improving public satisfaction is not an easy task; it is a continuous challenge and difficulty in poverty alleviation work. Given the diverse circumstances of poor households, their needs vary significantly, which undoubtedly increases the complexity and difficulty of enterprise poverty alleviation work. Enhance Communication and Demand Matching: Actively communicate with poor households to understand their needs and develop personalized poverty alleviation plans to ensure effective measures. Increase Transparency and Feedback: Improve the transparency of poverty alleviation work and establish feedback mechanisms, allowing poor households to participate in supervision and adjust poverty alleviation strategies in a timely manner. Focus on Practical Results: Avoid formalism and focus on practical results to ensure effective utilization of poverty alleviation resources and genuinely solve the problems of poor households. Strengthen Training and Capacity Building: Provide professional training for poverty alleviation staff to improve service quality and ensure precise implementation of poverty alleviation measures. Establish Long-term Participation Mechanisms: Encourage poor households to participate in the entire process of poverty alleviation projects and establish long-term assistance mechanisms to continuously consolidate poverty alleviation achievements. Through these measures, enterprises can not only improve public satisfaction but also enhance the overall quality and effectiveness of poverty alleviation work. Improving public satisfaction helps to enhance the living conditions of poor households, promote social harmony and progress, and also boost the social responsibility image of enterprises and their sustainable development capabilities. Therefore, enterprises must place great importance on public satisfaction, making it an important goal of poverty alleviation work and adopting practical and effective measures to continuously improve public satisfaction, contributing positively to the achievement of comprehensive poverty alleviation goals. Overall, enterprises engaged in poverty alleviation in the county have made positive progress, successfully helping some poor households out of poverty and providing a reference model for enterprise poverty alleviation process, mainly reflected in the insufficient precision of poverty alleviation, inadequate promotion efforts towards poor households, and lack of a comprehensive evaluation mechanism for poverty alleviation projects. Firstly, improving the precision of poverty alleviation is key to the success of enterprise poverty alleviation efforts. Enterprises need to further deepen their understanding of poor households, accurately identify their actual needs and causes of poverty, and develop more precise poverty alleviation strategies. This requires enterprises to invest more effort and resources in in-depth research and analysis to ensure that poverty alleviation measures can effectively address the actual problems of poor households. Secondly, strengthening communication and promotion with poor households is also an important way to enhance the effectiveness of enterprise poverty alleviation. Enterprises should use various channels and methods to increase the promotion of poverty alleviation policies and projects, enhancing poor households’ awareness and participation. This not only helps to boost the confidence and motivation of poor households but also improves the transparency and credibility of enterprise poverty alleviation work. Furthermore, establishing and improving evaluation mechanisms for poverty alleviation projects is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of poverty alleviation efforts.

This helps to identify and solve problems in the poverty alleviation process in a timely manner and continuously optimize and improve poverty alleviation strategies to enhance the quality and efficiency of poverty alleviation work.

Additionally, the government should reasonably and effectively supervise and evaluate the poverty alleviation activities of enterprises to ensure that their actions truly benefit poor households and achieve the ultimate goals of poverty alleviation. Moreover, enterprises should take on more social responsibility in poverty alleviation work, leveraging their advantages and strengths, and continuously innovate and improve poverty alleviation models and methods. Enterprises can provide more development opportunities and support for poor households through industrial poverty alleviation, employment poverty alleviation, educational poverty alleviation, and other means. Enterprises should also focus on the sustainability of poverty alleviation work, establishing long-term poverty alleviation mechanisms to ensure the consolidation and expansion of poverty alleviation achievements.
