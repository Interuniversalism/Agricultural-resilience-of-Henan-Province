This has significantly impeded the county-level beef cattle industry's breakthrough development in Henan Province. It is proposed that measures such as increasing government funding for key links, innovating financial and insurance measures, improving technical service system construction, vigorously supporting animal husbandry technology innovation, incubating and cultivating local well-known brands, creating and improving the entire industrial chain and innovative interest linkage mechanism, and so on be implemented. To serve as a model for accelerating the breakthrough development of the beef cattle industry in Jia County, Henan Province. With the continuous improvement of China's national economic level, the consumption capacity and consumption level of the people have also been further improved. Beef, as the third most consumed meat product in the world, has gradually been recognized by more and more Chinese people. Since 2000, the proportion of beef in my country's meat consumption has been continuously increasing, and the quality, grade and food safety of China's beef cattle industry are also facing new challenges. Jiaxian County, Henan Province is a large grain county and is famous for its Jiaxian Red Cattle, one of the eight fine-bred yellow cattle in China. The beef cattle breeding industry is also an important part of increasing farmers' income in Jiaxian County (Lei, 2019). Therefore, it has profound practical significance to ensure the high-quality development of the beef cattle industry in Jiaxian County. The improvement of the red cattle industry's industrial structure, extension of the industrial chain, promotion of the integration of the local agricultural primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, as well as an increase in the level of industrialised management, can all be achieved by fostering the development of the red cattle industry in Jiaxian County.(Ivanov & Sokolov, 2019) Jia County, a typical large traditional agricultural county in central Henan, with a sizable rural poor population, urban- rural inequalities, and a persistent wealth disparity, all of which contribute to social instability. In addition to raising farmers' income and enhancing their quality of life and living standards, promoting the development of the red cattle sector in Jiaxian County has the potential to reduce the gap between social groups in terms of income distribution and access to public amenities. Enhance the infrastructure of the red cattle breeding communities in Jiaxian County, transform cow manure into field treasures, and advance the development of a peaceful society there. (Halala, 2020). Jia County has placed a high value on the development of the Red Bull industry in recent years, and has issued a series of relevant policy documents that laid a policy foundation for the Red Bull industry in Jia County, as well as a policy basis for the high-quality development of the Red Bull industry in Jia County. Jiaxian County red cattle industry research can effectively promote high-quality development of the red cattle industry in Jiaxian County. (Bell & Harley, 2022). At the moment, the development of the red cattle industry in Jiaxian County is limited. Through research on the development of the red cattle industry in Jiaxian County, this paper identifies problems and causes in the development process and proposes appropriate countermeasures. It is beneficial to the development of the red cattle industry in Jiaxian County, and it can also serve as a theoretical In short, the development of Jiaxian’s characteristic red cattle industry is an important driving force to improve the income and living standards of farmers in Jiaxian(Jacob et al., 2021). On the one hand, the initial investment required in the beef cattle industry is substantial. The initial one-time investment is at least 100,000 yuan, which includes the cost of calves as well as comprehensive expenditures such as pens, manure treatment facilities, and epidemic prevention in the early stages. Furthermore, the supply of seed sources in Jia County is insufficient, and the red cattle varieties are mixed, raising the cost of breeding inputs even further. Farmers in Jiaxian County are under a lot of investment pressure, and they face a lot of uncertainty due to epidemic diseases, which makes most farmers discouraged. On the other hand, the loan requirement is rather large, bank loans demand collateral, and freshly constructed pens and transferred land typically cannot be utilised as mortgage assets, making it challenging for owners to get loans. Credit loans often have minimal amounts and a period of two years or less. However, the beef cattle industry has a lengthy investment return period, making short-term profit returns challenging. Additionally, Jiaxian County's insurance programme for the beef cattle business is not perfect, and there are not many claims. Typically, a deceased cow's compensation is only a few thousand yuan, which is far from sufficient to make up for the loss, and the risk of breeding is uncontrollable (Pohlmann et al., 2020).",
    "On the one hand, the majority of the Jia County beef cow breeding staff are descendants of farmers who abandoned the countryside. The labour force is often elderly, and knowledge is slowly updating. It is challenging to spread the use of sophisticated breeding management approaches. Jiaxian County, on the other hand, is devoid of academic research centres. The Jiaxian Red Cattle Breeding Demonstration Experimental Base only listed the Jiaxian Red Bull Research Institute in July 2022. This organisation is exposing talents and developing collaboration platforms because it is still in its infancy.It is difficult to achieve technological innovation in the short term, and the role of personnel training, technical services, and demonstration drives is also very limited. In addition, after the adjustment and reform of township divisions, animal husbandry and veterinary stations have not been retained, and grassroots animal husbandry and veterinary professional technicians are scarce, and some of them are part-time jobs. Even more weak technical services. A good brand effect can provide significant economic and social benefits to a company, and it is the number one priority in the development and promotion of an industry. Jiaxian Red Bull's brand building is currently low, the brand effect has not been realised, and it lacks a competitive advantage in the face of homogeneous competition. One the one hand, Jiaxian Red Bull's brand recognition isn't very high. Although Jiaxian Red Bull is a well-known brand of beef cow to the majority of residents in Jiaxian County and the neighbourhood. Jiaxian Red Bull does not have a competitive edge over other homogeneous beef cow brands in provinces with larger territories, developed regions, or even China because of its low brand awareness in these areas.On the other hand, Jiaxian Red Bull's brand-building strategy remains unclear. Despite having goods and names with distinctive advantages, like Jiaxian Red Bull. However, neither the government nor businesses currently have any well-defined plans on how to increase brand recognition and scale up Jiaxian Red Bull product promotion. The Jiaxian Red Bull brand has to be developed, but there is an urgent need to address the lack of appropriate capital investment and methodical development strategy. (Lei, 2019). On the one hand, the beef cattle industry has gradually lost its economic advantages in all facets of the business. The red cow breed is experiencing a provenance issue as a result of the modest size of red cattle breeding in Jiaxian County and the inconsistent supply of lineage. Additionally, there is a widespread lack of pasture of excellent quality, and feeding red cattle has a high breeding cost. No regional superior brand has emerged during the sales process as a result of the absence of a production and sales platform.Most of the beef cattle in Jia County mainly rely on dealers or middlemen for internal purchase and export, and the profit margin is further greatly reduced.In the processing link, in 2022, there will be only one large-scale slaughtering and processing plant for beef cattle in Jiaxian County, with an annual slaughtering and processing capacity of only tens of thousands of head, a serious shortage of slaughtering and processing capacity, a smaller proportion of intensive processing, a short industrial chain, weak anti- risk ability, and low added value . Jia County's beef cattle are primarily bought and sold internally by traders or middlemen, which further reduces the profit margin. In Jiaxian County, there will only be one large-scale plant for slaughtering and processing beef cattle by 2022, with an annual capacity of only tens of thousands of head. This will result in a severe shortage of capacity for slaughtering and processing, a smaller proportion of intensive processing, a short industrial chain, weak anti-risk ability, and low added value. (Leuschner & Charvet, 2013). The first is to strengthen industry financial support. The county government should increase subsidies, formulate preferential policies, and guide social capital to increase investment in all links of the industrial chain. The county government should integrate project funds, form a joint force, establish a diversified investment mechanism, improve the construction of investment and financing platforms, solve funding problems, and help the development of the beef cattle industry. The second is to innovate financial insurance measures. Guide financial institutions to innovate and develop special financial service products for the beef cattle industry, relax mortgage and pledge guarantee conditions, revitalize the assets of the beef cattle industry, moderately increase the amount of compensation, and help breeding owners reduce risks. And through government financial subsidies for premium funds, insurance companies to underwrite claims, and encourage farmers to actively participate in insurance, build and improve risk protection, and gradually improve the insurance mechanism for beef cattle breeding. The third is to guarantee land for the development of beef cattle industry. The land used for the construction of breeding production and its directly related agricultural facilities.",
    "One is to vigorously encourage technological innovation. Formulate incentive measures, give moderate preference to the approval and recommendation of scientific research projects, encourage scientific research institutions and enterprises to carry out scientific and technological research in key links of the industrial chain, and improve scientific and technological content to promote industrial upgrading. The second is to make the scientific research team bigger and stronger. Jiaxian agricultural scientific research institutions should continue to introduce professional scientific research talents in the field of beef cattle, strengthen the scientific research team, and improve scientific research capabilities. Deepen cooperation with institutions of higher learning and scientific research institutions. Focus on key links such as multiple beef cattle breeding, breed selection, and disease prevention and control to refine cooperation projects. Realization cooperation measures to jointly tackle key problems, and establish a long-term and stable scientific research cooperation platform. Improve scientific research innovation and achievement transformation capabilities. The third is to improve the technology service system. It is necessary to strengthen the introduction and cultivation of grassroots professional talents. And encourage enterprises and cooperatives to carry out paid technical services and grassroots talent training, and establish and improve the animal husbandry technology service system (Liu & McKinnon, 2016). “Brand is an inevitable choice for market development” (Qu, 2017). Brand is the long-term driving force of industrial development and a symbol of improving market competitiveness. It is imperative for Jia County to make a breakthrough in the development of the beef cattle industry and build a well-known brand in the beef cattle industry. It is imperative to enhance the added value of products and the competitiveness of the industrial region. On the one hand, beef cattle breeding should be further regulated. Increase human and material support for the introduction and promotion department, cultivate and expand local beef cattle breeding leading enterprises, improve the level of breeding technology, expand the scale of breeding, and ensure the supply of provenance. It is necessary to unify the technical standards and meat quality standards of the main varieties, and establish a unified and good industrial brand image. On the other hand, we must vigorously promote and cultivate high-quality brands. Digging deeply into Jiaxian Red Bull culture, packaging and planning brand trademarks. Comprehensively promote green and healthy breeding technology, strengthen the quality supervision of beef cattle products, expand organic product certification, actively cultivate corporate product brands and regional public brands, vigorously carry out brand marketing recommendations, and continuously improve the market influence of beef cattle products (Wang & Chen, 2017). One is to keep increasing the size of farms. Accelerating the promotion and implementation of cutting-edge feeding and management methods for beef cattle is important in addition to increasing the scale and breeding capacity of local beef cattle. Increase market share, strengthen the front end of the industrial chain, aid in the expansion and quickening of the beef cattle industry, and provide resource assurance for the construction of the complete industrial chain. The second is to significantly increase the capacity of beef cattle for processing and slaughter. Increased slaughter and processing capacity may not only address the issue of farm product sales, but also strengthen the industrial chain, significantly raise the added value of beef cattle products, increase the industry's resilience to risks, and improve market competitiveness. The third is to create and enhance the system for tying interests together. The government ought to direct businesses to develop a system that closely links the interests of agricultural businesses with those of the upstream and downstream industries. develop a mutually beneficial community of interests made up of \"slaughtering and processing firms + breeding enterprises/professional cooperatives + farmers\" gradually. Increase the sector's capacity to withstand market threats. Radiation encourages more farmers to join the industrial chain and increases farm income. To attain wealth ‘or everybody, hasten the high-quality growth of the beef cattle sector in Jiaxian County."
